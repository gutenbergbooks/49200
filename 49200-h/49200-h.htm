<p class='c007'>There are two, and only two, conceivable sources from
which the prodigious amount of energy possessed by
our sun and solar system can possibly have been
derived. Not only are these two sources radically
distinct in their essential nature, but both are admitted
to be real and not merely hypothetical sources of
energy. The one source is gravitation; the other,
the source discussed in the present volume, a source
to which attention was directed some twenty years
ago. A most important distinction between these two
sources is this: the amount of energy available from
the former can be accurately determined, but such is
not the case in regard to the latter. We can tell with
tolerable certainty the greatest amount of energy
which gravitation could possibly have conferred on
the sun and solar system; but we have, at present,
no means of assigning a limit to the possible amount
which might have been derived from the other source.
It may have been equal to that which gravitation
<span class='pageno' title='vi' id='Page_vi'></span>could afford, or it may have been twofold, fourfold, or
even tenfold that amount.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have evidently in this case a means of determining
which of the two sources will ultimately have
to be adopted as the source to which the energy of our
solar system must be referred. For if it can be proved
from the admitted facts of geology, biology, and other
sciences, that the amount of energy in the form of
heat which has been radiated into space by the sun
during geological time is far greater than the amount
which could possibly have been derived from gravitation,
this will undoubtedly show that gravitation cannot
account for the energy originally possessed by our
system.</p>

<p class='c008'>The First Part of the volume is devoted to the
consideration of what I believe to be the probable
origin of meteorites, comets, and nebulæ, and of the
real source from which our sun derived his energy.
The facts which support the theory here advocated,
together with the light which that theory appears to
cast upon those facts, are next considered; and it will
be found, I think, that the theory has been very much
strengthened by the recent important spectroscopic
researches of Mr. Lockyer and others in reference to
the constitution of nebulæ. The Second Part of the
work deals with the evidence in support of the theory
derived from the testimony of geology and biology as
to the age of the sun’s heat. The Third, and last,
<span class='pageno' title='vii' id='Page_vii'></span>Part has been devoted to questions relating to the
pre-nebular condition of the universe, and the bearing
which these have on theories of stellar evolution.
Several subjects introduced in this part are only very
briefly treated. These will, however, be considered
at greater length in a future volume, “Determinism,
not Force, the Foundation-stone of Evolution,” a work
of a more general and abstract character, which was
commenced many years ago.</p>

    <div><i>THE IMPACT THEORY OF STELLAR EVOLUTION.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Upwards of twenty years ago<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> the theory—or, I
should rather say, the hypothesis—was advanced<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
that our sun was formed from a hot gaseous nebula
produced by the colliding of two dark stellar masses;
and that, as the stars are suns like our own, they in
all likelihood had a similar origin. The probability
of this theory has been very much strengthened by
the facts, both astronomical and physical, which have
accumulated since the theory was enunciated. Before
proceeding to the consideration of these facts, and the
conclusions to which they lead, it will be necessary to
give a statement of the fundamental principles of the
theory.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the theory here discussed the truth of the
nebular hypothesis, which begins by assuming the
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>existence of a solar nebulous mass, is taken for
granted. The present theory deals not so much with
the nebulous mass itself as with the <i>formation</i> of the
nebula, and with those causes which led to its formation.
For convenience of reference, and to prevent
confusion, I have called it the “Impact Theory,” by
which name it may be distinguished, on the one hand,
from the nebular theory, and, on the other hand, from
the meteoric theory, and all other theories which
regard gravitation as the primary source of the solar
energy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The theory starts with the assumption that the
greater part of the energy possessed by the universe
exists or is stored up in the form of the motion
of stellar masses. The amount of energy which
may thus be stored up is startling to contemplate.
Thus a mass equal to that of the sun, moving with a
velocity of 476 miles per second, would possess, in
virtue of that motion, energy sufficient, if converted
into heat, to maintain the present rate of the sun’s
radiation for 50,000,000 years.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> There is nothing
extravagant in the assumption of such a velocity. A
comet, for example, having an orbit extending to the
path of the planet Neptune, approaching so near the
sun as to almost graze his surface in passing, would
have a velocity within 86 miles of what we have
assumed. Twice this assumed velocity would give
200,000,000 years’ heat; four times the velocity
would give 800,000,000 years’ heat; and so on.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are at perfect liberty to begin by assuming the
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>existence of stellar masses in motion; for we are not
called upon to explain how the masses obtained their
motion, any more than we have to explain how they
came to have their existence. If the masses were
created, they may as likely have been created in
motion as at rest; and if they were eternal, they may
as likely have been eternally in motion as eternally at
rest.</p>

<p class='c008'>Eternal motion is just as warrantable an assumption
as eternal matter. When we reflect that space
is infinite—at least in thought—and that, for aught
we know to the contrary, bodies may be found moving
throughout its every region, we see that the amount
of energy may be perfectly illimitable.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, illimitable as the amount of the energy may
be, it could be of no direct service while it existed
simply as the motion of stellar masses. The motion,
to be available, must be transformed into heat: the
motion of translation into molecular, or some other
form of motion. This can be done in no other
way than by arresting the motion of the masses.
But how is such motion to be arrested? How are
bodies as large as our earth, moving at the rate of
hundreds of miles per second, to have their motion
stopped? According to the theory this is effected by
<i>collision</i>: by employing the motion of the one body to
arrest that of the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Take the case of the formation of our sun according
to the theory. Suppose two bodies, each one-half
of the mass of the sun, moving directly towards each
other with a velocity of 476 miles per second. These
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>bodies would, in virtue of that velocity, possess
4149 × 10<sup>38</sup> foot-pounds of energy, which is equal
to 100,000,000,000 foot-pounds per pound of the
mass; and this, converted into heat by the stoppage
of their motions, would suffice to maintain, as was
previously stated, the present rate of the sun’s radiation
for a period of 50,000,000 years. It must be
borne in mind that, while 476 miles per second is the
velocity at the moment of collision, more than one-half
of this would be derived from the mutual attraction
of the two bodies in their approach to each
other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Coming in collision with such a velocity, the result
would inevitably be that the two bodies would shatter
each other to pieces. But, although their onward
motions would thus be stopped, it is absolutely impossible
that the whole of the energy of their motions
could be at once converted into heat; and it is equally
impossible that it could be annihilated. Physical
considerations enable us to trace, though in a rough
and general way, the results which would necessarily
follow. The broken fragments, now forming one
confused mass, would rebound against one another,
breaking up into smaller fragments, and flying off in
all directions. As these fragments receded from the
centre of dispersion they would strike against each
other, and, by their mutual impact, become shivered
into still smaller fragments, which would in turn be
broken up into fragments yet smaller, and so on as they
proceeded outwards. This is, however, only one part
of the process, and a part which would certainly
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>take place, though no heat were generated by the
collisions.</p>

<p class='c008'>A far more effective means of dispersing the fragments
and shattering them to pieces would be the
expansive force of the enormous amount of incandescent
gas almost instantaneously generated by the heat
of collision. The general breaking up of the two
masses and the stoppage of their motions would be
the work of only a few minutes, or a few hours at
most. The heat evolved by the arrested motion would,
in the first instance, be mainly concentrated on the
surface layers of the broken blocks. The layers would
be at once transformed into the gaseous condition,
thus enveloping the blocks and filling the interspaces.
It is difficult to determine what the temperature and
expansive force of this gas would at the moment be,
but evidently it would be excessive; for, were the whole
of the heat of the arrested motion distributed over
the mass, it would, as has been stated, amount to
100,000,000,000 foot-pounds per pound of the mass—an
amount sufficient to raise 264,000 tons of iron 1° C.
Thus, if we assume the specific heat of the gas to be
equal to that of air (viz. ·2374), it would have a
temperature of about 300,000,000° C. or more than
140,000 times that of the voltaic arc.</p>

<p class='c008'>I hardly think it will be deemed extravagant to
assume that at the moment after impact the temperature
of the evolved gas would be at least as great
as here stated. If we assume it to be so, it is obvious
that the broken mass would, by the expansive force
of the generated gas, be dispersed in all directions,
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>breaking up into fragments smaller and smaller as
they knocked against one another in their progress
outwards from the centre of dispersion; and these
fragments would, at the same time, become gradually
converted into the gaseous state, and gradually come
to occupy a space as large as that embraced in our
solar system. In the course of time the whole would
assume the gaseous condition, and we should then
have a perfect nebula—intensely hot, but not very
luminous. As its temperature diminished, the nebulous
mass would begin to condense, and ultimately,
according to the well-known nebular hypothesis, pass
through all the different phases of rings, planets, and
satellites into our solar system as it now exists.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am glad to find that the theory, in one of its
main features, has been adopted by Sir William
Thomson,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> the highest authority we have on all points
relating to the source of the sun’s heat.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We cannot,” says Sir William, “help asking the
question, What was the condition of the sun’s matter
before it came together and became hot? (1) It may
have been two cool, solid masses, which collided with
the velocity due to their mutual gravitation; or (2),
but with enormously less of probability, it may have
been two masses colliding with velocities considerably
greater than the velocities due to their mutual gravitation.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>He adopts the first of these suppositions. “To
fix the idea,” he continues, “think of two cool, solid
globes, each of the same mean density as the earth,
and of half the sun’s diameter, given at rest, or nearly
at rest, at a distance asunder equal to twice the earth’s
distance from the sun. They will fall together and
collide in exactly half a year. The collision will last
for about half an hour, in the course of which they
will be transformed into a violently agitated incandescent
fluid mass flying outward from the line of the
motion before the collision, and swelling to a bulk
several times greater than the sum of the original
bulks of the two globes. How far the fluid mass will
fly out all around from the line of collision it is impossible
to say. The motion is too complicated to be
fully investigated by any known mathematical method;
but with sufficient patience a mathematician might be
able to calculate it with some fair approximation to
the truth. The distance reached by the extreme circular
fringe of the fluid mass would probably be much
less than the distance fallen by each globe before
the collision, because the translational motion of the
molecules constituting the heat into which the whole
energy of the original fall of the globes becomes transformed
in the first collision is probably about three-fifths
of the whole amount of that energy. The time
of flying out would probably be less than half a year,
when the fluid mass must begin to fall in again towards
the axis. In something less than a year after the first
collision the fluid will again be in a state of maximum
crowding round the centre, and this time probably
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>even more violently agitated than it was immediately
after the first collision; and it will again fly
outward, but this time axially towards the places
whence the two globes fell. It will again fall inwards,
and after a rapidly subsiding series of quicker
and quicker oscillations it will subside, probably in
the course of two or three years, into a globular star
of about the same dimensions, heat, and brightness,
as our present sun, but differing from him in this,
that it will have no rotation.”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>This is precisely what I have been contending
for during the past twenty years, with the simple
exception that I assume, according to his second supposition,
that the “two masses collided with velocities
considerably greater than the velocities due to mutual
gravitation.” Sir William admits, of course, my supposition
to be quite a possible one, but rejects it on
the supposed ground of its improbability. His reasons
for this, stated in his own words, are as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“This last supposition implies that, calling the
two bodies A and B for brevity, the motion of the
centre of inertia of B relatively to A must, when the
distance between them was great, have been directed
with great exactness to pass through the centre of
inertia of A; such great exactness that the rotational
momentum or moment of momentum after collision
was no more than to let the sun have his present
slow rotation when shrunk to his present dimensions.
This exceedingly exact aiming of the one body at the
other, so to speak, is, on the dry theory of probability,
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>exceedingly improbable. On the other hand, there
is certainty that the two bodies A and B at rest in
space if left to themselves, undisturbed by other bodies
and only influenced by their mutual gravitation, shall
collide with direct impact, and therefore with no
motion of their centre of inertia, and no rotational
momentum of the compound body after the collision.
Thus we see that the dry probability of collision
between two neighbours of a vast number of mutually
attracting bodies widely scattered through space is
much greater if the bodies be all given at rest than
if they be given moving in any random directions and
with any velocities considerable in comparison with
the velocities which they would acquire in falling from
rest into collision.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir William here argues that the second supposition
is far less probable than the first, because,
according to it, the motion of the one body relatively
to the other must, in order to strike, be directed with
great exactness. The result, in such a case, is that
collision will rarely occur; whereas, according to the
first supposition, the two bodies starting from a state
of rest will, by their mutual gravitation, inevitably
collide. According to the second hypothesis they will
generally miss; according to the first they will always
collide.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have been led to a conclusion directly opposed
to Sir William’s. The fact, that, according to the
second supposition, collisions can but rarely occur is
one reason, amongst others, why I think that supposition
to be true; and the fact that, according to the first
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>supposition, collisions must frequently occur is also
one reason, amongst others, why I think it very improbable
that it can represent the true condition of
things.</p>

<p class='c008'>It by no means adds anything to the probability
of the first supposition to assert that, according to it,
such collisions will occur readily and frequently. On
the contrary, it would show that the supposition was
the less likely to be true. If the collisions were insufficient
in character, the fewer of them that occurred,
the better; for the result of such collisions would
simply be a waste of the potential energies of the universe.
We should in this case have an innumerable
host of imperfect suns without planets, or with at
most only one or two, and these at no great distance
from the luminary. There would thus be evolved
a universe without any grand planetary systems.
There is still another objection to the supposition.
The same gravitating force which makes the dark
bodies liable to come into collision with each other
must, of course, make them equally liable to come
into collision with the luminous bodies, and with our
sun amongst the rest. Our sun would, accordingly,
be at the mercy of any of those masses which might
happen to come within the reach of its attractive influence.
It would pull the mass towards it, and a
collision would be inevitable, unless it so happened
that a transverse motion of the sun itself might enable
it to escape destruction. Even in such a case it could
not by any means manage to get rid of the entangling
mass.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>All this risk, in so far as gravitation is concerned,
would have been completely averted if an original
projected velocity of some thirty or forty miles per
second had been conferred on the dark mass; for,
in this case, the attractive force of the sun would fail to
arrest its motion, and the mass would pass onward
through space, never to return. This simple conception
of an original motion removes entirely those
objections which, we have seen, besets the supposition
we have been considering. With such a motion, not
only would the risk to our solar system be removed,
but the collisions between the dark bodies themselves
would be a matter of rare occurrence; and hence the
energy of the universe would be conserved. And when
a collision did happen it would be on a grand scale,
and the result would be not an imperfect sun without
planets, but an incandescent nebula, out of which,
by condensation, a complete solar system would be
evolved. In fact, within the whole range of cosmical
physics, I know of nothing more impressive in its
sublime simplicity than this plan, by which the stability
and perfection of the universe is thus secured. How
vast the ends—how simple the means!</p>

<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div>I. <i>Probable Origin of Meteorites.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Recent researches establish beyond doubt that
stars, nebulæ, comets and meteorites, do not differ
much from our earth in their chemical constitution.
Meteorites, it is true, differ in their physical characteristics
from ordinary rock such as is found on the
earth’s surface. But it is possible, if not probable,
that the earth’s interior mass “may,” as Sir Henry
Roscoe remarks, “partake of the physical nature of
these metallic meteorites, and that if we could obtain
a portion of matter from a great depth below the
earth’s surface we should find it exactly corresponding
in structure as well as in chemical composition with a
metallic meteorite, and the existence of such interior
masses of metallic iron may go far to explain the
well-known magnetic condition of our planet.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a> I
think there can be little doubt that, were our earth
broken up into small fragments, and these scattered
into space, it would probably be impossible to distinguish
them from ordinary meteorites. The two
would be so like in character that one can hardly
resist the conviction that meteorites are but the fragments
of sidereal masses which have been shattered
by collision. That meteorites are broken fragments is
the opinion expressed by Sir William Thomson, who
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>says “that he cannot but agree with the common
opinion which regards meteorites as fragments broken
from larger masses, and that we cannot be satisfied
without trying to imagine what were the antecedents
of those masses.” The theory we have been considering
appears to afford an explanation of their antecedents.
According to it, they are broken fragments
of two dark stellar masses which were shattered to
pieces by collision. After what has been stated concerning
the production of the gaseous nebulæ out of
which our solar system was formed, it must be regarded
as highly improbable, if not impossible, that the
whole of the fragments projected outwards with such
velocity should be converted into the gaseous condition.
Multitudes of the smaller fragments, especially
those towards the outer circumference of the nebulous
mass, meeting with little or no obstruction to their
onward progress, would pass outwards into space
with a velocity which would carry them beyond the
risk of falling back into the nebula. They would then
continue their progress in their separated forms as
meteorites. If this be their origin, then meteorites
are the offspring of sidereal masses, and not their
parents, as Mr. Lockyer concludes.</p>

<p class='c008'>These meteorites must be of vast antiquity, for if
they are fragments of the dark bodies then they must
be not only older than our solar system, but older
than the nebula from which that system was formed.
Some of them, however, may have come from other
systems. They are fragments which may yet cast
some light on the history of the dark bodies.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>Comets, bodies which in many points seem allied
to meteorites, probably have, as we shall shortly see,
a similar origin.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div>II. <i>Motion of the Stars; how of such different velocities, and always in straight lines.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It will be only when the two bodies, coming from
contrary directions, collide with equal momentum
that the entire motion will be stopped. But in the
case of stellar masses moving, as it were, at random
in every direction this is a condition which will
but rarely occur. Accordingly, in most cases the resulting
stars will have more or less motion. In short,
the stars should, according to the theory, be moving
in all directions and with all varieties of velocity.
Further, it follows that these motions ought to be in
perfectly straight lines, and not in definite orbits of
any kind. So far as observation has yet determined,
all these conditions seem to be fulfilled. Sometimes
it will happen that the two bodies will strike each
other obliquely. In this case the resulting star, both
as to the direction and velocity of its motion, will, to
a large extent, be the resultant of the two concurrent
forces.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div>III. <i>Motion of the Stars not due to their Mutual Attractions.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>According to the theory the absolute motion of the
stars is due, not to the influence of gravity, but to
motions which originally belonged to the two component
masses out of which the star arose; motion
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>regarding the origin of which science can no more inform
us than it can regarding the origin of the masses
themselves. There is strong presumptive evidence
that the motion of the stars is due to this cause. We
know that there are stars which have a far greater
velocity than can result from gravitation, such, for
example, as the star 1830 Groombridge, which has
a velocity of 200 miles per second. Suppose, with
Professor Newcomb, that the number of stars belonging
to the universe amounts to 100,000,000, and that
these have, on the average, five times the mass of the
sun, and are spread out in a layer across which light
requires 30,000 years to pass. Then computation
shows that, unless the attractive power of the whole
were sixty-four times greater than it really is, it could
not have conferred on Groombridge the motion which
it possesses, or arrest it in its onward course.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> We
are therefore forced, as Professor Newcomb remarks,
to one of two alternatives, viz.: “Either the bodies
which compose our universe are vastly more massive
and numerous than telescopic examination seems to
indicate, or 1830 Groombridge is a runaway star,
flying on a boundless course through infinite space,
with such momentum that the attraction of all the
bodies of the universe can never stop it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>As regards the theory we are discussing, it is the
same which alternative is taken, for both are equally
favourable. If the former, then, according to the
theory that stellar heat had its origin in collision, it is
presumptive evidence that space is occupied by dark
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>bodies far more numerous and massive than the
luminous ones which the telescope reveals. If the
latter, viz. that the star has a velocity which never
could have been produced by attraction, “then,” as
says Professor Newcomb, “it must have been flying
forward through space from the beginning, and,
having come from an infinite distance, must now be
passing through our system for the first and only time.”
The probability is, however, that the star derived its
motion from the source from which it derived its
light and heat; namely, from the collision of the two
masses out of which it arose. If the star is ever
to be arrested in its onward course, it must be by
collision; but such an event would be its final end.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are other stars, such as 61 Cygni, ε Indi,
Lalande 21258, Lalande 21185, μ Cassiopeiæ, and
Arcturus, possessed of motions which could not have
been derived from gravity. And there are probably
many more of which, owing to their enormous distances,
the proper motions have not been detected.
α Centauri, the nearest star in the heavens, by less
than one-half, is distant twenty-one millions of millions
of miles; and there are, doubtless, many visible
stars a thousand times more remote. A star at this
distance, though moving transversely to the observer
at the enormous rate of 100 miles per second, would
take upwards of thirty years to change its position so
much as one second, and consequently 1,800 years to
change its position one minute. In fact, we should
have to watch the star for a generation or two before
we could be certain whether it was moving or not.</p>

<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div><span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>IV. <i>Probable Origin of Comets.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Great difficulty has been experienced in accounting
for the origin of comets upon the nebular hypothesis.
They approach the sun from all directions, and their
motions, in relation to the planets, are as often retrograde
as direct. Not only are their orbits excessively
elliptical, but they are also inclined to the ecliptic
at all angles from 0° to 90°. It is evidently impossible
to account satisfactorily for the origin of
comets if we assume them all to have been evolved
out of the solar nebula, although this has been
attempted by M. Faye and others. Comets are
evidently, as Laplace and Professor A. Winchell both
conclude, strangers to our system, and have come
from distant regions of space. If they belonged to
the solar system they could not, says Professor Winchell,
have parabolic and hyperbolic paths. “Only a
small portion of the comets,” he remarks, “are known
to move in elliptic orbits.”<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> This assumption that they
are foreigners will account for all the peculiarities of
their motions; but how are we to account for their
coming into our system? How did they manage to
leave that system in which they had their origin?
If a comet have come from one of the fixed stars
trillions of miles distant, the motion by which it
traversed the intervenient space could not, possibly,
have been derived from gravity. We are therefore
obliged to assume that the motion was a projected
motion. Comets, in all probability, have the same
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>origin as meteorites. The materials composing them,
like those of the meteorites, were probably projected
from nebulæ by the expulsive force of the heat of concussion
which produced the nebulæ. Some of them,
especially those with elliptic orbits, may have possibly
been projected from the solar nebula.</p>

    <div>V. <i>Nebulæ.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is a curious circumstance that the theory here
advanced seems to afford a rational explanation of
almost every peculiarity of nebulæ, as I have, on
former occasions, endeavoured, at some length, to
prove.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>1. <i>Origin of nebulæ.</i>—We have already seen that
the theory affords a rational account of the origin of
nebulæ.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. <i>How nebulæ occupy so much space.</i>—It accounts
for the enormous <i>space</i> occupied by nebulæ. It may
be objected that, enormous as would be the original
temperature of the solar system produced by the
primeval collision, it would nevertheless be insufficient
to expand the mass, against gravity, to such
an extent that it would occupy the entire space included
within the orbit of Neptune. But it will be
perceived, from what has already been stated regarding
the dispersion of the materials before they had
sufficient time to assume the gaseous condition, that
this dispersion was the main cause of the gaseous
nebula coming to occupy so much space. And, to go
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>farther back, it was the suddenness and almost instantaneity
with which the mass would receive the
entire store of energy, before it had time to assume
even the molten, not to say the gaseous, condition,
which led to tremendous explosions, followed by a
wide dispersion of materials.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. <i>Why nebulæ are of such varied shapes.</i>—Although
the dispersion of the materials would be in
all directions, it would, according to the law of probability,
very rarely take place uniformly in every
direction. There would generally be a greater
amount of dispersion in some directions than in
others, and the materials would thus be carried along
various lines and to diverse distances; and, although
gravity would tend to bring the widely scattered
materials ultimately together into one or more
spherical masses, yet, owing to the exceedingly rarified
condition of the gaseous mass, the nebulæ would
change form but slowly.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. <i>Broken fragments in a gaseous mass of an excessively
high temperature the first stage of a nebula.</i>—From
what has already been shown, it will be seen
that after the colliding of the two dark bodies the
first condition of the resulting nebula would be an
enormous space occupied by broken fragments of
all sizes dashing against each other with tremendous
velocities, like the molecules in a perfect gas. All
the interspaces between those fragments would be
entirely filled with a gaseous mass, which, at its
earliest stages at least, as in the case of the solar
nebula, would have a temperature probably more than
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>one hundred thousand times that of the voltaic arc.
Whether such a mass would be visible is a point
which can hardly be determined, as we can have no
experience on earth of a gas at such a temperature.</p>

<p class='c008'>That there are some of the nebulæ which appear
to consist of solid matter interspersed in a gaseous
mass is shown by the researches of Mr. Lockyer<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
and others. In fact, the theory is held by Professor
Tait<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a> that nebulæ consist of clouds of stones—or
meteor-swarms, as Mr. Lockyer would term them—in
an atmosphere of hydrogen, each stone of which,
moving about and coming into collision with some
other, is thereby generating heat which renders the
circumambient gas incandescent. In reference to
this theory of Professor Tait, Mr. Lockyer says that
the phenomena of the spectroscope can be quite well
explained “on the assumption of a cloud of stones,
providing always that you could at the same time
show reasonable cause why these clouds of stones
were ‘banging about’ in an atmosphere of hydrogen.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
The theory, however, does not appear to
afford any rational explanation of this banging about
of the stones to and fro in all directions; for, according
to it, the only force available is gravitation, and
this can produce merely a motion of the materials
towards the centre of the mass. Under these conditions
very little impinging of the stones against
each other would take place. But, according to the
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>theory here adopted, we have an agency incalculably
more effective than gravity, one which accounts not
merely for the impact of the stones, but for their very
existence as such, inasmuch as it explains both what
they are and whence they came.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Lockyer has recently fully adopted Professor
Tait’s suggestion as to the nature and origin of nebulæ,
and has endeavoured to give it further development.
He considers the nebulæ to be composed of sparse
meteorites, the collisions of which give the nebulæ
their temperature and luminosity. He divides the
nebulæ into three groups, “according as the formative
action seems working towards a centre; round a
centre in a plane, or nearly so; or in one direction
only.” As a result we have globular, spheroidal,
and cometic nebulæ.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Globular nebulæ</i> he accounts for in the following
manner. “If we,” he says, “for the sake of the
greatest simplicity consider a swarm of meteorites
at rest, and then assume that others from without
approach it from all directions, their previous paths
being deflected, the question arises whether there will
not be at some distance from the centre of the swarm
a region in which collisions will be most valid. If we
can answer this question in the affirmative, it will follow
that some of the meteorites arrested here will begin to
move in almost circular orbits round the common
centre of gravity.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The major axes of these orbits may be assumed to
be not very diverse, and we may further assume that,
to begin with, one set will preponderate over the rest.
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>Their elliptic paths may throw the periastron passage
to a considerable distance from the common centre of
gravity; and if we assume that the meteorites with
this common mean distance are moving in all planes,
and that some are direct and some retrograde, there
will be a shell in which more collisions will take place
than elsewhere. <i>Now, this collision surface will be
practically the only thing visible, and will present to
us the exact and hitherto unexplained appearance of
a planetary nebula—a body of the same intensity of
luminosity at its edge and centre—thus putting on an
almost phosphorescent appearance.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“If the collision region has any great thickness,
the centre should appear dimmer than the portion
nearer the edge.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Such a collision surface, as I use the term, is
presented to us during a meteoric display by the upper
part of our atmosphere.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><i>Spheroidal nebulæ</i>, he considers, are produced by
the rotation of what was at first a globular rotating
swarm of meteorites.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Cometic nebulæ</i> are explained, he considers, “on
the supposition that we have either a very condensed
swarm moving at a very high velocity through a sheet
of meteorites at rest, or the swarm at rest surrounded
by a sheet, all moving in the same direction.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In an able and interesting work, which seems
almost utterly unknown in England,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Professor
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>Winchell has advanced views similar to those of
Tait and Lockyer regarding the nature and origin
of nebulæ. But he, in addition, discusses the
further question of the origin of those swarms.
I shall have occasion to refer to Professor Winchell’s
views more fully when we come to the
consideration of the pre-nebular condition of the
universe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amongst the first to advance the meteoric hypothesis
of the origin and formation of the solar system
was probably the late Mr. Richard A. Proctor. This
was done in his work, “Other Worlds than Ours,”
published in 1870. “Under the continual rain of
meteoric matter,” he says, “it may be said that the
earth, sun, and planets are <i>growing</i>. Now, the idea
obviously suggests itself that the whole growth of the
solar system, from its primal condition to its present
state, may have been due to processes resembling
those which we now see taking place within its bounds.”
He further adds: “It seems to me that not only has
this general view of the mode in which our system has
reached its present state a greater support from what
is now actually going on than the nebular hypothesis
of Laplace, but that it serves to account in a far more
satisfactory manner for the principal peculiarities of
the solar system. I might, indeed, go farther, and
say that where those peculiarities seem to oppose
themselves to Laplace’s theory they give support to
those I have put forward.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a> He then goes on to show
the points wherein his theory seems to him to offer a
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>better explanation of those peculiarities than that of
Laplace.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. <i>The gaseous condition the second stage of a
nebula.</i>—The second stage obviously follows as a
necessary consequence from the first; for the fragments,
in the case under consideration, possess energy
in the form of motion, which, with the heat of their
circumambient vapour, is more than sufficient not only
to convert the fragments into the gaseous state, but to
produce complete dissociation of the chemical elements.
The complete transformation of the first stage into
the second must, therefore, be simply a matter of
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>According to the laws of probability it may, however,
sometimes happen that the two original dark
bodies will not collide with force sufficient to confer
on the broken fragments the energy required to convert
them all into the gaseous condition. The result
in this case would, no doubt, be that the untransformed
fragments, drawn together by their mutual attractions,
would collide and form an imperfect star or sun, without
a planet. Such a star might continue luminous
for a few thousands or perhaps a few millions of
years, as the case might be, when it would begin to
fade, and finally disappear. We have here an imperfect
nebula, resulting in an imperfect star. In
short, we should have in those stellar masses, on a
grand scale, what we witness every day around us
in organic nature, viz. imperfect formations. Such
occasional imperfections give variety and add perfection
to the whole. How dreary and monotonous
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>would nature be, were every blade of grass, every
plant, every animal, and every face we met formed
after the most perfect model!</p>

<p class='c008'>6. <i>The gaseous condition essential to the nebular
hypothesis.</i>—It is found that the density of the
interior planets of our solar system compared with
that of the more remote is about as five to one. The
obvious conclusion is that there is a preponderance of
the metallic elements in the interior planets and of
metalloids in the exterior. It thus becomes evident,
as Mr. Lockyer has so clearly shown,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> that when our
solar system existed in a nebulous condition the metallic
or denser elements would occupy the interior portion
of the nebula and the metalloids the exterior. Taking
a section of this nebula from its centre to its circumference,
the elements would in the main be found
arranged according to their densities: the densest at
the centre, and the least dense at the circumference.
If we compare the planets with their satellites, we
find the same law holding true. The satellites of
Jupiter, for example, have a density of about only
one-fifth of that of the planet, or about one twenty-fifth
of that of our earth, showing that when the
planet was rotating as a nebulous mass the more
dense elements were in the central parts and the less
dense at the outer rim, where the satellites were being
formed. Again, if we take the case of our globe, we
find, as Mr. Lockyer remarks, the same distribution
of materials, proving that when the earth was in the
nebulous state the metallic elements chiefly occupied
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>the central regions, and the metalloids those outer
parts which now constitute the earth’s crust.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these facts show that the <i>sifting</i> and <i>sorting</i>
of the chemical elements according to their densities
must have taken place when our solar system was in
the condition of a nebula. But, further, it seems impossible
that this could have taken place had the
materials composing the nebula been in the solid
form, even supposing that they had taken the form of
clouds of stones.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is equally impossible that the nebula could have
been in the fluid or liquid state during this process.
This is obvious, for the nebula must then have
occupied, at least, the entire space within the orbit of
the most remote planet. But our solar system in the
liquid condition could not occupy one-millionth part
of that space. It is therefore evident that the nebula
must have been in the state of a gas, and a gas of
extreme tenuity.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. <i>The mass must have possessed an excessive
temperature.</i>—There is ample evidence, Mr. Lockyer
thinks, to show that the temperature of the solar
nebula was as great as that of the sun at the present
time. But I think it is extremely probable that, in
some of its stages, the nebula had a very much higher
temperature than that now possessed by the sun.
There must, during the sifting period, have been
complete chemical dissociation, so as to keep the
metals and the metalloids uncombined, and thus
allow the elements to arrange themselves according
to their densities. The nebula hypothesis, remarks
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>Mr. Lockyer, “is almost worthless unless we assume
very high temperatures, because, unless you have heat
enough to get perfect dissociation, you will not have that
sorting out which always seems to follow the same law.”</p>

<p class='c008'>8. <i>Gravitation could, under no possible condition, have
generated the amount of heat required by the nebular
hypothesis.</i>—The nebular hypothesis does not profess
to account for the origin of nebulæ. It starts with
matter existing in space in the nebulous condition,
and explains how, by condensation, suns, planets &amp;c.
are formed out of it. In fact, it begins at the middle
of a process: it begins with this fine, attenuated
material in the process of being drawn together and
condensed under the influence of attraction, and professes
to explain how, as the process goes on, a solar
system necessarily results. To simplify our inquiry
we shall confine our attention to the solar nebula, and
consider in the first place how far condensation may
be regarded as a sufficient source of heat.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='fss'>A.</span> <i>Condensation.</i>—The heat which our nebula
could have derived from condensation up to the time
that Neptune was detached from the mass, no matter
how far the outer circumference of the mass may have
originally extended beyond the orbit of that planet,
could not have amounted to over 1/7,000,000 of a thermal
unit (772 foot-pounds) for each cubic foot. It is
perfectly obvious that this amount could not have
produced the dissociation required; and without the
required dissociation Neptune could never have been
formed. Further, it is physically impossible that the
materials of which our solar system are composed
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>could have existed in the gaseous state in a cool condition
prior to condensation. Unless possessed of
great heat, even hydrogen could not exist in stellar
space in the gaseous form; and far less could carbon,
iron, platinum, &amp;c. Before Neptune could have been
formed the whole of the materials of the system must
have possessed heat, not only sufficient to reduce them
to the gaseous state, but sufficient to produce complete
dissociation. But by no conceivable means could
gravitation have conferred this amount of heat by the
time that the mass had condensed to just within the
limits of the orbit of Neptune.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='fss'>B.</span> <i>Solid globes colliding under the influence of
gravity alone.</i>—As we have already seen, the view has
been adopted by Sir W. Thomson that the solar
nebula may have resulted from the colliding of cold,
solid globes with the velocity due to their mutual
gravitation alone. He states his views as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Suppose, now, that 29,000,000 cold, solid globes,
each of about the same mass as the moon, and
amounting in all to a total mass equal to the sun’s,
are scattered as uniformly as possible on a spherical
surface of radius equal to one hundred times the
radius of the earth’s orbit, and that they are left absolutely
at rest in that position. They will all commence
falling towards the centre of the sphere, and
will meet there in 250 years, and every one of the
29,000,000 globes will then, in the course of half an
hour, be melted, and raised to a temperature of a few
hundred thousand or a million degrees Centigrade.
The fluid mass thus formed will, by this prodigious
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>heat, be exploded outwards in vapour or gas all round.
Its boundary will reach to a distance considerably less
than one hundred times the radius of the earth’s
orbit on first flying out to its extreme limit. A
diminishing series of out-and-in oscillations will
follow, and the incandescent globe, thus contracting
and expanding alternately, in the course, it may be, of
300 or 400 years, will settle to a radius of forty times
the radius of the earth’s orbit.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The reason which he assigns for the incandescent
globe settling down at a radius forty times that of the
earth’s orbit is as follows: “The radius of a steady
globular gaseous nebula of any homogeneous gas is
40 per cent. of the radius of the spherical surface
from which its ingredients must fall to their actual
positions in the nebula to have the same kinetic
energy as the nebula has.”</p>

<p class='c008'>If the solar nebula thus produced would be swelled
out into a spherical incandescent mass with a radius
40 times the radius of the earth’s orbit, simply because
the globes fell from a distance of 100 times the radius
of that orbit, then for a similar reason the mass would
have a radius of 400 times that of the earth’s orbit
had the globes fallen from a distance of 1,000 times
the radius, and 400,000 times if the globes had fallen
from a distance of 1,000,000 times the radius, and
two-fifths of any conceivable distance from which
they may have fallen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Supposing all this to be <i>physically</i> possible, which
it undoubtedly is not, still the heat generated would not
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>be sufficient; for, whatever the radius of the nebula
might be, its entire energy, both kinetic and potential,
is simply what is obtained from gravitation, and this,
as we have seen, is insufficient.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. <i>Condensation the third and last condition of a
nebula.</i>—According to the gravitation theory, condensation
is the first stage of a nebula as well as the
last; for, according to it, gravity is the force which
both collects together the scattered materials and gives
them their heat.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a> Before condensation begins there
can, according to the gravitation theory, be no such
thing as a nebula properly so called. The materials
exist, of course, but they do not exist in the form of a
nebula. According to the impact theory which I here
advocate, condensation cannot begin till after the
nebula has begun to lose the heat with which it was
originally endowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. <i>How nebulæ emit such feeble light.</i>—The light
of nebulæ is mainly derived from glowing hydrogen
and nitrogen in a condition of extreme gaseous
tenuity; and it is well known that these gases are
exceedingly bad radiators. The oxyhydrogen flame,
although its temperature is surpassed only by that of
the voltaic arc, gives a light so feeble as to be scarcely
visible in daylight. The small luminosity of nebulæ
is, however, mainly due to a different cause. The
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>enormous space occupied by those bodies is not so
much due to the heat which they possess as to the
fact that their materials were dispersed into space
before they had time to pass into the gaseous condition;
so that, by the time that this latter state was
assumed, the space occupied was far greater than was
demanded either by the temperature or by the amount
of heat which they originally received. If we adopt
the nebular hypothesis of the origin of our solar
system, we must assume that our sun’s mass, when
in the condition of a nebula, extended beyond the
orbit of the planet Neptune, and consequently filled the
entire space included within that orbit. Even supposing
Neptune’s orbit to have been its outer limit, which,
obviously, was not the case, it would nevertheless
have occupied 274,000,000,000 times the space it
does at present. We shall assume, as before, that
50,000,000 years’ heat was generated by the concussion.
Of course, there might have been twice or
even ten times that quantity; but it is of no importance
what amount is in the meantime adopted.
Enormous as 50,000,000 years’ heat is, it yet gives,
as we shall presently see, only 32 foot-pounds of
energy for each cubic foot. The amount of heat due
to concussion being equal, as before stated, to
100,000,000,000 foot-pounds for each pound of the
mass, and a cubic foot of the sun at his present
density of 1·43 weighing 89 pounds, each cubic foot
must have possessed 8,900,000,000,000 foot-pounds.
But when the mass was expanded sufficiently to
occupy 274,000,000,000 times its original space
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>(which it would do when it extended to the orbit of
Neptune), the heat possessed by each cubic foot
would then amount to only 32 foot-pounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>In point of fact it would not even amount to so
much, for a quantity equal to upwards of 20,000,000
years’ heat would necessarily be consumed in work
against gravity in the expansion of the mass, all of
which would, of course, be given back in the form of
heat as the mass contracted. During the nebulous
condition, however, this quantity would exist in an
entirely different form, so that only 19 out of the
32 foot-pounds per cubic foot generated by concussion
would then exist as heat. The density of the nebula
would be only 1/16,248,160 that of hydrogen at ordinary
temperature and pressure. The 19 foot-pounds of
heat in each cubic foot would thus be sufficient to
maintain an excessive temperature; for there would
be in each cubic foot only 1/440,000 of a grain of matter.
But, although the <i>temperature</i> would be excessive, the
<i>quantity</i> both of light and heat in each cubic foot
would of necessity be small. The heat being only 1/71 of
a thermal unit, the light emitted would certainly be
exceedingly feeble, resembling very much the electric
light in a vacuum-tube.</p>

<p class='c008'>The theory affords a rational explanation of the
origin of binary stars. Binary stars, in so far as
regards their motion, follow also, of course, as a consequence,
from the gravitation theory. If two bodies
come into grazing collision, “they will,” says Sir
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>William Thomson, “commence revolving round their
common centre of inertia in long elliptic orbits. Tidal
interaction between them will diminish the eccentricities
of their orbits, and, if continued long enough,
will cause them to revolve in circular orbits round
their centre of inertia.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a> This conclusion was pointed

    <div>VII. <i>Sudden Outbursts of Stars.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The case of a star suddenly blazing forth and then
fading away, such as that observed by Tycho Brahe
in 1572, may be accounted for by supposing that the
star had been struck by one of the dark bodies—an
event not at all impossible, or even improbable. In
some cases of sudden outbursts, such as that of Nova
Cygni, for example, the phenomenon may result from
the star encountering a swarm of meteorites. The
difficulty in the case of Nova Cygni is to account for
the very sudden decline of its brilliancy. This might,
however, be explained by supposing that the outburst
of luminosity was due to the destruction of the
meteorites, and not to any great increase of heat produced
in the star itself. A swarm of meteorites converted
into incandescent vapour would not be long in
losing its brilliancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Lockyer thinks that the outburst was produced
by the collision of two swarms of meteorites, and not
by the collision of the meteorites with a previously
existing star.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>Amongst the millions of stars occupying stellar

nebula breaking up into a host of separate
nuclei, each of which becomes a star. The irregular
manner in which the materials would, in many cases,
be widely distributed through space after collision
would prevent a nebula from condensing into a single
mass. Subordinate centres of attraction would be
established, as was long ago shown by Sir William
Herschel in his famous memoir on the formation
of stars;<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> and around these the gaseous particles
would arrange themselves and gradually condense

    <div>IX. <i>Age of the Sun’s Heat: a Crucial Test.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>When we come to the question of the age of the
sun’s heat, and the length of time during which that
orb has illuminated our globe, it becomes a matter of
the utmost importance which of the two theories is
to be adopted. On the age of the sun’s heat rests
the whole question of geological time. A mistake
here is fundamental. If gravitation be the only
source from which the sun derived its heat, then life
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>on the globe cannot possibly date farther back than
20,000,000 years; for under no possible form could
gravitation have afforded, at the present rate of
radiation, sufficient heat for a longer period. It will
not do to state in a loose and general way, as has
been frequently done, that the sun may have been
supplying our globe with heat at its present rate
for 20,000,000 or 100,000,000 years, for gravitation
could have done no such thing; a period of
20,000,000, not 100,000,000, years is the lowest which
is admissible on that theory. Not even that length of
time would be actually available; for this period is
founded on Pouillet’s estimate of the rate of solar
radiation, which has been proved by Langley to be
too small, the correct rate being 1·7 times greater.
“Thus,” as says Sir W. Thomson, “instead of Helmholtz’s
20,000,000 years, we have only 12,000,000.”
But the 12,000,000 years would not in reality be
available for plant and animal life; for undoubtedly
millions of years would elapse before our globe could
become adapted for either flora or fauna. If there is
no other source of heat for our system than gravitation,
it is doubtful if we can calculate on much more
than half that period for the age of life on the earth.
Professor Tait probably over-estimates the time when
he affirms “that 10,000,000 years is about the utmost
that can be allowed, from the physical point
of view, for all the changes that have taken place on
the earth’s surface since vegetable life of the lowest
known form was capable of existing there.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> And this
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>is certainly about all that can ever be expected from
gravitation; mathematical computation has demonstrated
that it can give no more. The other theory,
founded on motion in space—a cause as real as
gravitation—labours under no such limitation. According
to it, so far at least as regards the store of
energy which may have been possessed by the sun,
plant and animal life may date back, not to 10,000,000
years, but to a period indefinitely more remote. In
fact, there is as yet no known limit to the amount of
heat which this cause may have produced; for this
depended upon the velocities of the two bodies at the
moment prior to collision, and what these velocities
were we have no means of knowing. They might
have been 500 miles a second, or 5,000 miles a second,
for anything which can be shown to the contrary.
Of course I by no means affirm that it is as much
as 100,000,000 years since life began on our earth;
but I certainly do affirm that, in so far as a possible
source of the sun’s energy is concerned, life may have
begun at a period as remote.</p>

Will the length of time which, according to
the gravitation theory, can possibly be allotted satisfy
the requirements of geology? In short, are the facts
of geology reconcilable with the theory? If not, the

<p class='c008'>Before the period when geologists felt that they

most extravagant opinions prevailed in regard to the

continued to state in a loose and general way that the

of matters was entirely altered. The belief
that the mathematical physicist must be right in his
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>views as to the age of the sun’s heat, and that there
is no possibility of a longer period being admitted,
seems at present to be leading geologists towards the
opposite extreme in regard to the length of geological
time. Attempts have been recently made to compress
the geological history of our globe into the narrow
space allotted by the physicist. The attempt is hopeless,
as well as injurious to geological science. What
misleads is not the belief that gravitation could not
possibly afford a supply of heat sufficient for more
than 20,000,000 years, for this is true; it is the
belief that there was no other source of heat than
gravity.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall now consider the evidence which geology
seems to afford as to the age of the sun’s heat.
Geology is quite competent to render aid on this
point, for the sun’s heat must be at least as old as
life on this globe; and the record of the rocks tells us
when this life first appeared. We require, however,
to be able to measure the time which has elapsed since
these records were left. What we want is absolute
time; not relative time. Much has been done by
geologists in regard to relative time; but this can be
of no service to us in our present inquiry. Unfortunately
very little trustworthy work has been done in
the way of determining the absolute length of geological
periods. Happily, however, great exactness of
measure is not required. A rough approximation to
the truth will suffice for our present purpose. If
it can be shown to be more than fifteen or twenty
millions of years since life first appeared on the earth,
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>it will as effectually prove that gravitation alone could
not have been the source from which the sun derived
his heat as if it were shown that that period was a
thousand times more remote. All we have to do is
simply to assign an <i>inferior limit</i> to the age of life on
the earth; and this can be effectually done by means
of the methods, imperfect though they be, which we
have at command. As the question of geological time
is of some importance in relation to our present
inquiry, I shall consider it at some length.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Testimony of Geology: method employed.</i>—What
has subsequently proved to be a pretty successful
method of measuring geological time suggested itself
to my mind during the summer of 1865. It then
occurred to me that we might obtain a tolerably
accurate measure of absolute geological time from
the present rate of subaërial denudation, which might
be ascertained in the following way: The rate of
subaërial denudation must be equal to the rate at
which materials are carried off the land into the sea;
and this is measured by the rate at which sediment is
carried down by our river systems. <i>Consequently, in
order to determine the present rate of subaërial denudation,
we have only to ascertain the quantity of sediment
annually carried down by the river systems.</i> This gives
us the time required to remove any given quantity,
say one foot, off the face of the country. If we
assume the rate to be pretty much the same during
past geological ages, we have a means of telling the
time that was occupied in removing any known thickness
of strata. But as we never can be perfectly
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>certain that the rate is the same in both cases, the
results can, of course, be regarded as only approximately
true.</p>

<p class='c008'>Taking the quantity of sediment discharged into
the sea annually by the Mississippi river, as determined
by Messrs. Brown and Dickson,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a> I found that
it amounted to one foot off the face of the country
in 1,388 years, and that, at this rate of denudation,
our continents, even if they had an elevation of
1,000 feet, would not remain above sea-level over
1,500,000 years.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> This was an exaggerated estimate
of the quantity of sediment, for I shortly afterwards
found that far more accurate determinations were
made by Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a> who were
employed by the United States Government to report
upon the physics and hydraulics of the Mississippi.
Messrs. Brown and Dickson had estimated the quantity
of sediment at 28,188,083,892 cubic feet, whereas
Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot found it to be only
6,724,000,000 cubic feet, or less than one-fourth that
amount. This gives one foot in 6,000 years as the
rate of denudation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>At this time Dr. Archibald Geikie took up the
question and went into the consideration of the subject
in a most thorough manner; and it is mainly
through the instrumentality of his writings on the
matter<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> that the method under consideration has
gained such wide-spread acceptance among geologists.
After an examination of nearly all that is known regarding
the amount of sediment carried down by
rivers, he drew up the following table, showing the
number of years required by seven rivers to remove
one foot of rock from the general surface of their
basins.</p>

</table>

<p class='c008'>This gives a mean of 3,378 years to remove one
foot, or a little over one-half the time taken by the
Mississippi. This mean appears to be generally
taken as representing the average rate of subaërial
denudation of the whole earth, but it has, I fear, been
rather too hastily adopted. To estimate correctly the
quantity of sediment annually discharged by a large
river is a most difficult and laborious undertaking.
A perusal of the voluminous report of Messrs. Humphreys
and Abbot, extending over 690 pages, which
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>Dr. Geikie justly styles a model of patient and exhaustive
research, will clearly show this, and at the
same time prove how skilfully and accurately the task
allotted to them was performed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The risk of making very serious errors in computing
the amount of sediment discharged, unless proper
precautions are taken, is well illustrated in the case
of the determinations made by Messrs. Brown and
Dickson, to which reference has already been made.
Although their report shows that they took great
pains in order to arrive at correct results—in fact,
they computed the total annual quantity of sediment
discharged to within a cubic foot—after all, instead
of being correct to this minute quantity, they
gave a total more than fourfold what it ought to be.
A somewhat similar discrepancy exists in reference to
the denudation of the basin of the Ganges. The time
required to lower its surface by one foot is, according
to one estimate, 2,358 years; according to another,
1,751; and according to a third, only 1,146 years.
The first figure is probably nearest the truth. Still,
these differences show both the difficulty of the problem
and the necessity of caution in adopting any
of these results as correct.</p>

<p class='c008'>By far the most trustworthy determinations of the
whole are those of the Mississippi by Messrs. Humphreys
and Abbot, which may be relied upon as not far
from the truth. But, supposing the estimates in the
foregoing table to be perfectly correct, can we assume
that their mean may be safely taken as probably representing
the average rate of denudation of the whole
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>earth? I would most unhesitatingly reply, Certainly
not. The Rhone and Po are full of glacier mud
from the Alps; and the amount of sediment which
they carry down may give us the rate of denudation
of Switzerland, but certainly not that of the whole
earth, or even of Europe. The same may be said of
the Ganges, which is charged with the mud which it
brings down from the Himalaya Mountains. The
Hoang-Ho, or Yellow River, is an exceptionally muddy
river; in fact, it derives its name from the vast quantity
of yellow mud held by its waters in a state of
solution. It was probably the exceptionally muddy
character of the Po, the Rhone, the Ganges, and the
Yellow River which attracted attention, and led to
observations being made of the sediment they contain.
Rivers more unsuitable than these to give us the
average denudation of the earth’s surface could not
well be selected. Among the seven rivers in the table,
leaving out of account the small Scottish stream, the
Nith, with its basin of only 200 square miles, there are
only two, the Mississippi and the Danube, that drain
countries which may be regarded as in every way
resembling the average condition of the earth’s surface.
I would choose the Mississippi as being superior
to the Danube, for two reasons: (1) because
the rate of denudation of its basin has been more
accurately determined; and (2) because the area of
its basin not only exceeds that of the Danube as five to
one, but better fulfils the necessary conditions, as Sir
Charles Lyell has so clearly shown. “That river,”
says Sir Charles, “drains a country equal to more
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>than half the continent of Europe, extends through
twenty degrees of latitude, and therefore through
regions enjoying a great variety of climate, and some
of its tributaries descend from mountains of great
height. The Mississippi is also more likely to afford
us a fair test of ordinary denudation, because, unlike
the St. Lawrence and its tributaries, there are no
great lakes in which the fluviatile sediment is thrown
down and arrested on its way to the sea.”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a> There is
no other river in the globe which to my mind better
fulfils the required conditions. It is no doubt true
that the rate of denudation of the basin of the Mississippi
is probably less than that of Switzerland, Norway,
and the Himalayas, where glaciers abound, and
certainly less than that of Greenland and the Antarctic
continent; but, on the other hand, this rate is
certainly much greater than that of the whole continent
of Africa, Australia, and large tracts of Asia,
where the rainfall is much smaller. One foot in
6,000 years may, therefore, I think, be safely taken
as the average rate of denudation of the whole surface
of the globe.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The average rate of denudation in the past probably
not much greater than in the present.</i>—The belief
has long prevailed that the rate of denudation was
much greater in past ages than it is now; but I am
unable to perceive any good grounds for concluding
that such was the case at any time since the beginning
of the Palæozoic period. Various reasons have,
however, been assigned for this supposed greater rate;
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>and to the consideration of these I shall now very
briefly refer.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been thought that at some remote epoch of
the earth’s history, when the moon was much nearer
and the day much shorter than now, the rate of denudation
would, owing to the erosive power of the
enormous tides which would then prevail, be much
greater than at the present day. This, however, is
very doubtful. There is nothing in the stratified
rocks which affords any support to the idea of great
tidal waves having swept over the land, at least
since the time when life began on our globe. Such a
state of things would have destroyed all animal life.
“The Palæozoic sediments,” as Professor A. Winchell
remarks, “have been deposited, for the chief part, in
quiet seas. The deep beds of limestones and shales
are spread out in sheets continent-wide, which testify
unmistakably to placid waters and slow deposition.”<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
But high tides, not sweeping over the land, would
not increase the rate of denudation to the extent supposed.
High tides silt up a river channel more readily
than they deepen it. A higher tide would probably
produce a greater destruction of sea-coast: it would
tend to increase the rate of marine denudation, but
this would not materially affect the general rate of
denudation. For, as the present rate of marine denudation
is to that of subaërial denudation only as
1 to about 1,700,<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a> it would take a very large increase
in the rate of marine denudation to affect sensibly the
general result. Suppose the rate of marine denudation
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>to have been, for example, ten times as great
during the Palæozoic age as it is now (which it certainly
was not), it would only have shortened the
time required to effect a given amount of denudation
of the whole earth by 9 years in 1,700, i.e. by little
more than one-half per cent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, it is assumed that the greater rate of
terrestrial rotation in the early ages would produce
certain influences which would in turn bring about a
greater amount of denudation. The rate of rotation
has been slowly decreasing for ages, and in Palæozoic
times it must, of course, have been greater than at
present. A more rapid rotation would increase the
velocity of the trade and anti-trade winds, and would
thus tend to augment the action of those meteorological
agents chiefly effective in the work of subaërial
denudation. Here again the testimony of geology is
negative. We have no geological grounds to conclude
that the winds of Palæozoic times were stronger than
those at the present day. The heat was no doubt
greater, and perhaps there was more rain; but, on
the other hand, there would be less frost, snow, ice,
and other denuding agents.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is one cause which would, perhaps, be more
effective than any of the foregoing: viz. the periodic
occurrence of glacial epochs. When a country is
buried under ice, the erosion of the surface is great.
But it must be borne in mind that the influence of
rain, rivers, and other denuding agents now in operation
would then, in the glaciated regions, be almost
<i>nil</i>. Besides, the greater part of the materials ground
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>off the rocks would be left on the land; and, when the
ice disappeared, it would be found in the form of a
thick mantle of boulder clay—a mantle which would
protect the rocky surface of the country for thousands
and tens of thousands of years from further denudation.
This is shown by the fine striæ on the rocky
surface, made perhaps more than 50,000 years ago,
remaining under the boulder clay as perfect as the day
on which they were engraved. But, more than all
this, a very considerable part of the 1 foot presently
being removed off the country in 6,000 years consists
of the loose materials belonging to the glacial epoch,
such as sands, gravels, and boulder clay, which are
being swept off the surface by rain and river action.
Were it not for this, the present rate of subaërial
denudation would not be so high as it actually is.
Taking all things into consideration, it is, I think,
obvious that the average rate of denudation since the
beginning of Palæozoic times was probably not much
greater than at the present day.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>How the method has been applied.</i>—Having determined
what appears to be the probable average rate
of subaërial denudation, we may now proceed to consider
the way in which this rate has been applied to
measure past geological time. There are two ways in
which it may be applied for this purpose. It may (1)
be applied directly: knowing the thickness of strata
which may have been removed by denudation, we can
easily tell, from that rate, the time it required to effect
their removal. If we have evidence, for example, that
at some epoch 1,000 feet of stratified rock were
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>carried away, then, on the assumption that the rate of
denudation was the same at that epoch as now, we
have 1,000 × 6,000 = 6,000,000 years as the required
time. (2) It may be applied indirectly:
knowing the thickness of the strata, we may estimate
the time required for their formation. This is the
way in which it has usually been applied, but, as we
shall see, it is the less satisfactory way of the two.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. A. Geikie gives the land area of the globe
as 52,000,000 square miles, and that of water as
144,712,000 square miles.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a> We may thus take the
proportion of land to water roughly as 1 to 3; about
one-quarter of the earth’s surface being land, and
three-quarters water. One foot, therefore, removed
off the surface of the land would cover the whole
globe with a layer 3 inches thick, or the entire sea-bottom
with a layer 4 inches thick.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we knew the total quantity of stratified rock
on the globe, we could easily tell the time that
would be required for its formation. Most geologists
would, I believe, be inclined to admit that, if spread
uniformly over the entire globe, it would form a layer
of at least 1,000 feet in thickness. In such a case
the time required for its deposition would be as
follows:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>1,000 × 6,000 × 4 = 24,000,000 years.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This would not, however, represent the age of the
stratified rocks. It would only represent the time
required to deposit the rocks which we have assumed
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>to be now in existence. The greater mass of sedimentary
rocks has been formed out of previously
existing sedimentary rocks, and these again out of
sedimentary rocks still older. The oldest known
sedimentary rocks are the Laurentian; but these
are believed by geologists to have been formed from
still older sedimentary rocks. It is therefore evident
that the materials composing our stratified beds
must have passed through many cycles of destruction
and re-formation. The materials of some of
the recent formations, for example, may have passed
through denudation and deposition a dozen of times
over.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a> The time required to have deposited at a
given rate the present existing mass of sedimentary
rocks is probably but a small fraction of the time
required to have deposited at the same rate the total
mass that has actually been formed. Few geologists,
I think, who will duly reflect on the subject, will deem
it too much to say that the present existing stratified
rocks have on an average passed at least thrice
through the cycle of destruction and re-formation. If
this be admitted, then the 1,000 feet of stratified
rock represent, not a period of 24,000,000 years, but
a period three times as great, viz. 72,000,000 years.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is impossible to tell from geological data the
actual age of the stratified rocks; but this is not
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>required. What we require is, as already stated, not
their <i>actual</i> age, but an <i>inferior limit</i> to that age.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Method as applied by Professor Haughton.</i>—Professor
Haughton estimates the mass of the stratified
rocks down to the time of the Miocene Tertiary period
as being 177,200 feet in thickness, and covering an
area equal to that of the sea. The present rate of
subaërial denudation he considers to be equal to one
foot removed off the surface of the land in 3,090 years.
If the proportion of land to water be taken as 52 to
145, it thus requires 8,616 years to deposit one foot
of sediment over the bed of the ocean, and consequently
this is the rate at which strata are at present
being formed. This would give 8,616 × 177,200
= 1,526,750,000 years for the age of the stratified
rocks. But he assumes the rate of denudation to
have been <i>ten times</i> greater in geological time than
at present. This consequently reduces the age of
the rocks to 152,675,000 years. By adding one-third
for the time which has elapsed since the Miocene
Tertiary period he gets 200,000,000 years as a
minimum length of geological time.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The validity of this result rests upon what appear
to me to be two very doubtful assumptions. It is
assumed in his calculations that the total amount
of strata formed during past ages (not the amount
presently remaining) was equal to a mass 177,200
feet in thickness, covering the entire area of the
ocean. This is certainly doubtful. It may have
been as great, for anything that can be proved to the
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>contrary; but we have no evidence that it was so.
Certainly there is no evidence that the rate of
subaërial denudation during past ages was ever ten
times as great as it is now. But how is a length of
200,000,000 years to be reconciled with the age of
the sun’s heat? The stratified rocks may be as old
as this, but assuredly they are not if gravitation was
the only source from which the sun derived his
energy.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Method as applied by Mr. Alfred R. Wallace.</i>—Mr.
Wallace adopts Professor Haughton’s estimate
of 177,200 feet for the maximum thickness of the
sedimentary rocks. But, instead of supposing, like
Professor Haughton, the products of denudation to
be uniformly spread over the entire sea-bottom, he
supposes them spread over a belt of merely 30
miles broad, extending along the entire coast-line of
the globe, which he estimates at 100,000 miles.
This gives an area of 3,000,000 square miles on
which the denuded matter of the whole land area of
57,000,000 square miles is deposited. These two
areas are to one another as 1 to 19, and thus it
follows that deposition goes on 19 times as fast
as denudation. The rate of denudation he takes as
one foot removed off the surface of the land in 3,000
years, so that the rate of deposition would be about
one foot in 158 years, and consequently the time
required to deposit the 177,200 feet of rock would be</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>177,200 × 158 = 27,997,600 years.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This is a period double what the gravitation theory
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>of the source of the sun’s energy can afford. And if
the rate of denudation be taken at one foot in 6,000
years, which is, as we have seen, probably nearer the
truth, then this would make the age of the stratified
rocks 56,000,000 years.</p>

<p class='c008'>There seems to be a little ambiguity about Mr.
Wallace’s result. Do the 177,200 feet represent the
quantity of rock which presently exists, or do they
represent the total quantity which has been formed
during all past ages? If the former, then the
28,000,000 years are but a fraction of the time
which must have been required; for, as we have
been shown, the materials composing the stratified
rocks have, on an average, been deposited at least
three or four times over. If, on the other hand, the
thickness is meant to represent the total quantity of
rock which has been formed during the whole of past
geological time, then the question arises, by what
means could this quantity possibly be ascertained?
In other words, how was the relation between the
present quantity and the total quantity ascertained?
But in either case the result is wholly irreconcilable
with the gravitation theory of the source of the sun’s
heat.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Method as applied directly.</i>—We have seen that it
is impossible to determine the actual age of the earth
from the stratified rocks, even if we knew with perfect
accuracy their present total amount. We have also
seen that from the rate of deposition we cannot fix
with any degree of certainty a minimum value for the
age of these rocks. We can, however, by means of
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>the first or direct application of the method, assign
with tolerable accuracy, as was shown on a former
occasion,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a> a minimum age to the earth. We can be
far more certain of the time which must have been
required to remove by denudation, say, a thousand
feet of rock than we can possibly be of the time required
to have deposited a thousand feet of sediment.
The thousand feet of sediment may, under certain
conditions, have been deposited in a hundred years,
while under other conditions they may have required
a million of years. In fact, nothing can be more uncertain
than the rate of deposition: it depends upon
such a multitude of circumstances. At the mouth of
a great river, for example, a foot of sediment may be
deposited in a single day, whereas in some places, as
in mid-ocean, it may require a million of years to deposit
the same amount. But in reference to subaërial
denudation no such uncertainty exists.</p>

<p class='c008'>The utter inadequacy of a period of 20,000,000
years for the age of our earth is demonstrable from
the enormous thickness of rock which is known to
have been removed off certain areas by denudation.
I shall now briefly refer to a few of the many facts
which might be adduced on this point.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Evidence from “faults.”</i>—One plain and obvious
method of showing the great extent to which the
general surface of the country has been lowered by
denudation is furnished, as is well known, by the way
in which the inequalities of surface produced by faults
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>or dislocations have been effaced. It is quite common
to meet with faults where the strata on the one side
have been depressed several hundreds—and in some
cases thousands—of feet below those on the other;
but we seldom find any indications of such on the
surface, the inequalities on the surface having been
all removed by denudation. Now, in order to effect
this, a mass of rock must have been removed equal in
thickness to the extent of the dislocation. The following
are a few examples of large faults:</p>

<p class='c008'>The great Irwell fault, described by Professor Hull,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
which stretches from the Mersey west of Stockport to
the north of Bolton, has a throw of upwards of 3,000
feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some remarkable faults have been found by Professor
Ramsay in North Wales. For example, near
Snowdon, and about a mile E.S.E. of Beddgelert,
there is a fault with a downthrow of 5,000 feet; and
in the Berwyn Hills, between Bryn-mawr and Post-gwyn,
there is one of 5,000 feet. In the Aran Range
there is a great fault, designated the Bala fault, with
a downthrow of 7,000 feet. Again, between Aran
Mowddwy and Careg Aderyn the displacement of the
strata amounts to no less than from 10,000 to 11,000
feet.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a> Here we have evidence that a mass of rock,
varying from one to two miles in vertical thickness,
must have been denuded in many places from the
surface of the country in North Wales.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fault which passes along the east side of the
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>Pentlands is estimated to have a throw of upwards of
3,000 feet.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c015'><sup>[36]</sup></a> Along the flank of the Grampians a great
fault runs from the North Sea at Stonehaven to the
estuary of the Clyde, throwing the Old Red Sandstone
on end sometimes for a distance of two miles from the
line of dislocation. The amount of the displacement,
Dr. A. Geikie<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a> concludes, must in some places be not
less than 5,000 feet, as indicated by the position of
occasional outliers of conglomerate on the Highland
side of the fault.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great fault crossing Scotland from near Dunbar
to the Ayrshire coast, which separates the Silurians
of the South of Scotland from the Old Red Sandstone
and Carboniferous tracts of the North, has been found
by Mr. B. N. Peach, of the Geological Survey,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a> to
have in some places a throw of fully 15,000 feet.
This great dislocation is older than the Carboniferous
period, as is shown by the entire absence of any Old
Red Sandstone on the south side of the fault, and by
the occurrence of the Carboniferous Limestone and
Coal-measures lying directly on the Silurian rocks.
We obtain here some idea of the enormous amount of
denudation which must have taken place during a
comparatively limited geological epoch. So vast a
thickness of Old Red Sandstone could not, as Mr.
Peach remarks, “have ended originally where the
fault now is, but must have swept southwards over
the Lower Silurian uplands. Yet these thousands of
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>feet of sandstones, conglomerates, lavas, and tuffs
were so completely removed from the south side of
the fault previous to the deposition of the Carboniferous
Limestone series and the Coal-measures,
that not a fragment of them is anywhere to be
seen between these latter formations and the old
Silurian floor.”<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a> This enormous thickness of nearly
three miles of Old Red Sandstone must have been
carried away during the period which intervened
between the deposition of the lower members of the
Lower Old Red Sandstone and the accumulation of
the Carboniferous Limestone.</p>

<p class='c008'>Near Tipperary, in the south of Ireland, there is a
dislocation of the strata of not less than 4,000 feet,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
which brings down the Coal-measures against the
Silurian rocks. Here 1,000 feet of Old Red Sandstone,
3,000 feet of Carboniferous Limestone, and 800 feet
of Coal-measures have been removed by denudation
off the Silurian rocks. Not only has this immense
thickness of beds been carried away, but the Silurian
itself on which they rested has been eaten down in some
places into deep valleys several hundreds of feet below
the surface on which the Old Red Sandstone rested.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>Turning to the American continent, we find the
amount of rock removed to be even still greater. In
the Valley of Thessolon, to the north of Lake Huron,
there is a dislocation of the strata to the extent of
9,000 feet.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In front of the Chilowee Mountains there is a
vertical displacement of the strata of more than
10,000 feet.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Professor H. D. Rogers found in the
Appalachian coal-fields faults ranging from 5,000 feet
to more than 10,000 feet of displacement.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Nova Scotia coal-fields one or two miles
in thickness of strata have been removed in some
places.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>A great fracture runs along the axis of the Sierra
Nevada for 300 miles, accompanied by a dislocation
of 3,000 to 10,000 feet.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The anticlinal of the Park Range of the Rocky
Mountains was cleft down the axis, and the eastern
half depressed 10,000 feet. And Mr. J. P. Lesley
gives an account of a fault in the Appalachians of not
less than 20,000 feet, bringing the upper Devonian
strata on the one side opposite to the lowest Cambrian
on the other.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>A fault with a vertical displacement of 20,000 feet
was found in the Uinta Mountains.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In the Aqui range of mountains, Utah, there is a
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>fault determined by Mr. S. F. Emmons to be at least
10,000 feet.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The Grand Cañon of Colorado, in some places
4,000, 5,000, and 6,000 feet in depth, is cut, says Professor
A. Winchell, in a plateau which has itself been
lowered by erosion to the extent of 10,000 feet; and
this plateau occupies an area of 13,000 to 15,000
square miles.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The Grand “Wash Fault,” Colorado, has a downthrow
to the west of 6,000 feet. The “Hurricane
Fault,” close to it, has displaced the strata to the extent
of over 12,000 feet.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c015'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In the Valley of East Tennessee, Appalachian
Mountains, it has been shown by Mr. J. P. Lesley
that as much as 35,000 feet of rock have been removed
by denudation. But this being from an anticlinal
arch, it does not, of course, afford any measure
of the extent of the denudation of the surrounding
country. Major J. W. Powell, Director of the U.S.
Geol. Survey, found that under a similar condition as
much as three and a half miles of strata have been
removed by denudation from the top of anticlinal beds
in the Uinta Mountains.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c015'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Probably the most enormous displacement of
strata which has yet been found is that of the
“Wahsatch Fault,” Utah. This fault is about 100
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>miles in length, crossing the fortieth parallel of
latitude from north to south, with a downthrow to
the west of not less than 40,000 feet. So clear is the
evidence regarding this fault that Mr. Clarence King
says “that there can be no doubt of the quantitative
correctness of my reading of this tremendous
dislocation.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c015'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>There are other modes than the foregoing by
means of which geologists are enabled to measure the
thickness of strata which may have been removed in
places off the present surface of the country. Into
the details of these I need not here enter; but I may
give a few examples of the enormous extent to which
the country, in some places, has been found to have
been lowered by denudation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. A. Geikie has shown<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a> that the Pentlands must
at one time have been covered with Carboniferous
rocks, upwards of a mile in thickness, which have all
been removed by denudation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Bristol coal-fields, between the river Avon
and the Mendips, Sir Andrew C. Ramsay has shown<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a>
that about 9,000 feet of Carboniferous strata have been
removed by denudation from the present surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>Between Bendrick Rock and Garth Hill, South
Glamorganshire, a mass of Carboniferous and Old
Red Sandstone, of upwards of 9,000 feet, has been
removed. At the Vale of Towy, Caermarthenshire,
about 6,000 feet of Silurian and 5,000 feet of Old Red
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>Sandstone—in all about 11,000 vertical feet—have
been swept away. Between Llandovery and Aberaeron
a mass of about 12,000 vertical feet of the
Silurian series has been removed by denudation.
Between Ebwy and the Forest of Dean, a distance of
upwards of 20 miles, a thickness of rock varying from
5,000 to 10,000 feet has been abstracted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prof. Hull found<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a> on the northern flanks of the
Pendle Range, Lancashire, the Permian beds resting
on the denuded edges of the Millstone Grit, and these
were again observed resting on the Upper Coal-measures
south of the Wigan coal-field. Now from
the known thickness of the Carboniferous series in
this part of Lancashire he was enabled to calculate
approximately the quantity of Carboniferous strata
which must have been carried away between the period
of the Millstone Grit and the deposition of the Permian
beds, and found that it actually amounted to no
less than 9,900 feet. He also found in the Vale of
Clitheroe, and at the base of the Pendle Range, that
the Coal-measures, the whole of the Millstone Grit,
the Yoredale series, and part of the Carboniferous
Limestone, amounting in all to nearly 20,000 feet,
had been swept away—an amount of denudation
which, as Prof. Hull remarks, cannot fail to impress
us with some idea of the prodigious lapse of time
necessary for its accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be observed that, enormous as is the
amount of denudation indicated by the foregoing
figures, these figures do not represent in most cases
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>the actual thickness of rock removed from the surface.
We are necessitated to conclude that a mass of rock
equal to the thickness stated must have been removed,
but we are in most cases left in uncertainty as to the
total thickness which has actually been carried away.
It cannot be imagined that these great disruptions
occurred first when the surface became subject to denuding
agencies, or that denudation ceased to operate
precisely when the inequality was smoothed away.
Moreover, during the time the surface on one side of
the fault was being reduced, some amount of denudation
must also have been in progress on the other and
lower side. In the case of a fault, for example, with a
displacement of, say, one mile, where no indication of
it is seen at the surface of the ground, we know that
on one side of the fault a thickness of rock equal to one
mile must have been denuded, but we do not know
how much more than that may have been removed.
For anything which we know to the contrary, hundreds
of feet of rock may have been removed before the dislocation
took place, and as many more hundreds after
all indications of dislocation had been effaced at the
surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it must be observed that the total quantity of
rock which has been removed from the <i>present</i> surface
of the land is evidently small in proportion to the total
quantity removed during the past history of our globe.
For those thousands and thousands of feet of rock
which have been denuded were formed out of the
waste of previously existing rocks, just as these had
been formed out of the waste of yet older rock-masses.
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>In short, as a general rule, the rocks of one epoch
have been formed out of those of preceding periods,
and go themselves to form those of subsequent epochs.</p>

<p class='c008'>In many of the cases of enormous denudation to
which we have referred, the erosion has been effected
during a limited geological epoch. We have, for
example, seen that upwards of a mile in thickness of
Carboniferous rock has been denuded in the area of
the Pentlands. But the Pentlands themselves, it can
be proved, existed as hills, in much their present form,
before the Carboniferous rocks were laid down over
them; and as they are of Lower Old Red Sandstone
age, and have been formed by denudation, they must
consequently have been carved out of the solid rock
between the period of the Old Red Sandstone and the
beginning of the Carboniferous age. This affords us
some conception of the immense lapse of time represented
by the Middle and Upper Old Red Sandstone
periods.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, in the case of the great fault separating the
Silurians of the south of Scotland from the Old Red
Sandstone tracts lying to the north, a thickness of
the latter strata of probably more than a mile, as we
have seen, must have been removed from the ground
to the south of the fault before the commencement of
the Carboniferous period. And again, in the case of
the Lancashire coal-fields, to which reference has been
made, nearly two miles in thickness of strata had
been removed in the interval which elapsed between
the Millstone Grit and the Permian periods.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Time required to effect the foregoing amount of
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>denudation.</i>—To lower the country one mile by
denudation would therefore require, according to
the rate which we have already established, about
15,000,000 years; but we have seen that a thickness
of rock more than equal to that must have been
swept away since the Carboniferous period; and even
during the Carboniferous period itself more than a
mile in thickness of strata in many places was
removed. Again, there can be no doubt whatever
that the amount of rock removed during the Old Red
Sandstone period was much greater than one mile;
for we know perfectly well that over large tracts
of country nearly a mile in thickness of rock was
carried away <i>between the period of the Lower Old Red
Sandstone and the Carboniferous epoch</i>. Further, all
geological facts go to show that the time represented
by the Lower Old Red Sandstone itself must have
been enormous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, three miles of rock removed since the
commencement of the Old Red Sandstone period
(which, doubtless, is an under-estimate) would give us
45,000,000 years.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, going farther back, we find the lapse of
time represented by the Silurian period to be even
more striking than that of the Old Red Sandstone.
The unconformities in the Silurian series indicate
that many thousands of feet of these strata were
denuded before overlying members of the same great
formations were deposited. And again, this immense
formation was formed in the ocean by the slow denudation
of pre-existing Cambrian continents, just as
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>these had been built up out of the ruins of the still
prior Laurentian land. And even here we do not
reach the end of the series, for the Laurentians
themselves resulted from the denudation, not of the
primary rocks of the globe, but of previously existing
sedimentary and probably igneous rocks, of which,
perhaps, no recognisable portion now remains.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the opinion of Mr. Darwin, and also of Mr.
Wallace, that the geological time which elapsed anterior
to the Cambrian period was as long as the
whole interval from that period to the present day.
This is an opinion which I suppose is supported by
most geologists. But, to err on the safe side, I shall
assume that the time which had elapsed prior to the
Old Red Sandstone was not greater than the time
which has elapsed since that period. Even on this
assumption we have at least 90,000,000 years as a
minimum duration of geological time.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Age of the earth as determined by the date of the
glacial epoch.</i>—Professor A. Winchell, by a most
careful examination of the probable relative lengths
of geological periods, arrived at the conclusion that
the time which elapsed since the beginning of the
<i>glacial epoch</i> is to the time which has elapsed since
the solidification of the earth’s surface as 1 to 250.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a>
According to the eccentricity theory of the cause of
the glacial epoch, that epoch began 240,000 years
ago; consequently this makes the time since solidification
took place 60,000,000 years, a period which
agrees roughly with that deduced from denudation,
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>and is so far presumptive evidence of the truth of that
theory of the cause of the glacial cold.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Testimony of Biology</i>.—The time required for the
variation and modification of organic forms has, Mr.
Alfred R. Wallace states, been generally considered to
require an even longer series of ages than might
satisfy the demands of physical geology. This is a
point, however, on which I am not qualified to venture
an opinion. I shall simply refer to the views held by
our highest authorities on the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>Referring to Professor Huxley’s anniversary address
to the Geological Society in 1870, where he
shows that almost all the higher forms of life must
have existed during the Palæozoic period, Mr. Wallace
says: “Thus, from the fact that almost the whole of
the Tertiary period has been required to convert the
ancestral Orohippus into the true horse, he, Professor
Huxley, believes that, in order to have time for the
much greater change of the ancestral ungulata into
the two great odd-toed and even-toed divisions (of
which change there is no trace even among the earliest
Eocene mammals), we should require a large portion,
if not the whole, of the Mesozoic or Secondary period.
Another case is furnished by the bats and whales,
both of which strange modifications of the mammalian
type occur perfectly developed in the Eocene formation.
What countless ages back must we, then, go for
the origin of these groups, the whales from some ancestral
carnivorous animal, and the bats from the
insectivora! And even then we have to seek for the
common origin of carnivora, insectivora, ungulata,
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>and marsupials at a far earlier period; so that, on the
lowest estimate, we must place the origin of the mammalia
very far back in Palæozoic times.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c015'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>“If the very small differences,” says Professor
Huxley,<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c015'><sup>[57]</sup></a> “which are observable between the <i>Crocodilia</i>
of the older Mesozoic formations and those of the present
day furnish any sort of approximation towards
an estimate of the average rate of change among the
<i>Sauropsida</i>, it is almost appalling to reflect how far
back in Palæozoic times we must go before we can
hope to arrive at that common stock from which the
<i>Crocodilia</i>, <i>Lacertilia</i>, <i>Ornithoscelida</i>, and <i>Plesiosauria</i>,
which had attained so great a development in the
Triassic epoch, must have been derived.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The <i>Amphibia</i> and <i>Pisces</i> tell the same story.
There is not a single class of vertebrated animals
which, when it first appears, is represented by analogues
of the lowest known members of the same class.
Therefore, if there is any truth in the doctrine of
evolution, every class must be vastly older than the
first record of its appearance upon the surface of the
globe. But if considerations of this kind compel us
to place the origin of vertebrated animals at a period
sufficiently distant from the Upper Silurian, in which
the first Elasmobranchs and Ganoids occur, to allow
of the evolution of such fishes as these from a
vertebrate as simple as the <i>Amphioxus</i>, I can only
repeat that it is appalling to speculate upon the
extent to which that origin must have preceded the
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>epoch of the first recorded appearance of vertebrate
life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If the theory be true,” says Mr. Darwin, “it is indisputable
that before the lowest Cambrian stratum
was deposited long periods elapsed—as long as, or
probably far longer than, the whole interval from the
Cambrian age to the present day; and that during
these vast periods the world swarmed with living
creatures.”<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In referring to the abundant and well-developed
fauna of the Cambrian period, Sir Andrew C. Ramsay
remarks:<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a> “In this earliest known varied life we find
no evidence of its having lived near the beginning of
the Zoological series. In a broad sense, compared
with what must have gone before, both biologically
and physically, all the phenomena connected with this
old period seem, to my mind, to be quite of a recent
description; and the climates of seas and lands were
of the very same kind as those that the world enjoys
at the present day—one proof of which, in my opinion,
is the existence of great glacial boulder beds in the
Lower Silurian strata of Wigtonshire, west of Loch
Ryan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Professor Haeckel remarks that “Darwin’s theory,
as well as that of Lyell, renders the assumption of immense
periods absolutely necessary. If the theory of
development be true at all, there must certainly have
elapsed immense periods, utterly inconceivable to us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In reference to the foregoing, Mr. Wallace says:<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>“These opinions, and the facts on which they are
founded, are so weighty that we can hardly doubt
that, if the time since the Cambrian epoch is correctly
estimated at 200,000,000 of years,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c015'><sup>[61]</sup></a> the date of the
commencement of life on the earth cannot be much
less than 500,000,000; while it may not improbably
have been longer, because the reaction of the organism
under changes of the environment is believed to have
been less active in low and simple than in high and
complex forms of life, and thus the processes of organic
development may for countless ages have been excessively
slow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I think it must now be perfectly evident that the
facts both of geology and of biology are utterly irreconcilable
with the theory that the sun’s heat was derived
from the condensation of its mass by gravitation; and
that the mistake in regard to geological time has been
committed by the physicist, and not by the geologist.
The grounds upon which the geologists and the
biologists found the conclusion that it is more than
20 or 30 millions of years since life began on the
earth are far more certain and reliable than the
grounds upon which the physicist concludes that the
period must be less. The only real ground that the
physicist has is that according to the theory which he
holds of the origin of the sun’s heat a longer period is
not possible. This might be considered good evidence
were no other theory possible; but there is another
theory, which accords with all the facts, and consequently
has a strong presumption in its favour.</p>

    <div><i>EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE THEORY FROM THE PRE-NEBULAR CONDITION OF THE UNIVERSE.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The nebular hypothesis, strictly speaking, is one
simply intended to account for the origin of our solar
system. “It is,” as remarks Professor A. Winchell,
“primarily a genetic explanation of the phenomena of
the solar system; and accessorily a co-ordination, in a
common conception, of the principal phenomena in
the stellar and nebular firmament, as far as human
vision has been able to penetrate.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a> The theory starts
with the assumption that all the materials composing
the solar system once existed in a state of extreme
tenuity and diffusion, filling far more than the entire
space included within the orbit of the most remote
planet. It begins with this diffused nebulous mass
tending slowly, under the influence of gravitation,
towards a state of aggregation. Beyond this point
the received nebular hypothesis does not extend.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be observed that the theory here begins in
the middle of a process. It begins with the assumption
of a mass in the act of condensing under the
influence of gravity. It offers no explanation of
the origin of the mass, or how it came to be in this
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>attenuated state, or in what condition it existed before
the materials began to draw together. These are,
however, inquiries which naturally force themselves
on our attention. If the nebular theory be a true
theory of the origin of the solar system, then
this nebulous mass must have had an antecedent
history, and we cannot help feeling the instinctive
desire of tracing the chain of causation farther back.
The mind presses towards an absolute beginning.
It is the goal to which it aspires, and no amount of
failure will ever deter it from renewing its efforts.
Of recent years a considerable amount of attention
has been devoted to inquiries in this direction; nearly
all of which, it is true, has necessarily been of a speculative
and hypothetical character. But hypothesis,
as Mr. Locyker remarks, is the life-blood of investigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nebular hypothesis is so highly probable as to
have gained almost universal acceptance. In fact, it
contains very little of a hypothetical nature. It is, as
Mr. Mill says, “an example of legitimate reasoning
from a present effect to its past cause, according to
the known laws of that cause.” Like the hypothesis
of a luminiferous ether, if it is not a true theory, one
would almost think that it deserves to be so.</p>

<p class='c008'>There seems no reason why inquiries should stop
at the point where Laplace began. The same line of
reasoning may yet carry us back into the pre-nebular
region, and perhaps with as great a degree of certainty
as it has done in the nebular; though, no doubt, the
farther back we proceed, the more difficult probably
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>will the inquiry become. But, be all this as it may,
there can be little doubt that the path of investigation
is a legitimate one, and also one which is worthy of
being traced out.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall now briefly refer to some of the leading
views which have been expressed in regard to the
pre-nebular history of the universe, and shall afterwards
consider the additional light which the theory
discussed in this volume seems to cast on the
subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>The commonly received opinion is that the nebulæ
were formed from ordinary matter existing in a high
state of division, and widely diffused through space.
The “cosmical dust,” as it is called, was the universal
“world-stuff,” out of which all things were supposed
to be formed. It is held that in receding backwards
in pre-nebular times, the smaller, more simple, and
elementary the materials were. Out of this primitive
cosmical dust, or world-stuff, by aggregation, the
materials became successively larger and more complex.
The theory of the origin of nebulæ, on this
principle, has been clearly stated by Professor Winchell,
and I here give a brief outline of his views on
the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Professor A. Winchell on the pre-nebular condition of
matter.</i>—This cosmical dust, or world-stuff, he considers
to be scattered promiscuously through boundless
space. It is cold and non-luminous, and is acted
upon by forces of attraction and probably of repulsion.
The material particles, either as atoms or less probably
as molecules, are drawn by mutual attraction
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>into groups and swarms. Any central attractive
force, as of a sun or planet, by causing the particles
to move in converging lines, would cause them
to become approximated and ultimately aggregated.
Thus both mutual attractions and centric movements
would tend to produce aggregations dispersed through
space. But in the presence of two or more attractive
centres, as in the present constitution of the Cosmos,
it is impossible that any mass shall fall directly upon
its centre of attraction. Hence motions of rotation
will be established in the mass, and also orbital motions
of masses about each other. In addition to the
mutual attraction of the molecules, the convergence
of their paths towards centres of attraction must also
tend to the formation of masses and swarms of masses
and particles. “We have then,” he says, “to picture
indefinite space as pervaded by swarms of masses and
particles of dark matter. Each mass or particle may,
nevertheless, be separated by thousands of miles. It
is manifest, therefore, that each mass or particle will
eventually dispose itself, under the fixed action of the
forces of matter, in some definite order. It is manifest
also, from what has been said, that each swarm
will have a progressive motion along a path having
the essential character of an orbit around some dominant
centre of attraction. If, as seems to be the fact,
an ethereal medium, or any condition of interplanetary
matter, exists in space, it opposes the movements
of these swarms by opposing the motion of each constituent
mass. But the smaller masses—the particles
and molecules—would feel this resistance to the
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>greatest extent. They would therefore fall behind the
heavier masses, and would be most deflected toward
the attracting centre. The smallest particles would
be driven farthest to the rear, and dispersed farthest
from the orbit of the train, along the side turned
toward the principal attraction. The swarm would
present an elongated form, in which the larger and
heavier masses would move foremost, and nearest the
line of the orbit—that is, near the exterior skirt of
the area covered by the general swarm—while the
smaller ones would follow, in graduated succession,
in a long train which would present a fan-like expansion
lying mostly on the inside of the path of the
principal masses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“This, it may be conceived, is the mode of aggregation
of these cosmical matters in the depths of
space. Of course the attractions which control them
are feeble; their movements are slow, the resistances
are relatively inconsiderable, and the elongation of
the swarm is correspondingly inconspicuous. What I
have described is a tendency which would be present.
Sometimes the controlling attraction would be only
another cosmical swarm. The two swarms would revolve
similarly about their common centre of gravity,
while prolonged resistances would cause their slow
approximation and final coalescence at the common
centre of gravity. Sometimes the controlling attraction
would be exerted by a distant sun, around which
it would slowly move, continually gathering up additions
of matter from the wide fields of space.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In most cases all controlling attraction would be
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>feebly felt. These clouds of cosmical dust would float
practically poised in the midst of space, and would
gradually grow by the continued accession of new
matter. Some of them would become aggregates of
large dimensions, and their attraction would be distinctly
felt by other aggregates. There would be a
tendency of such aggregates to approach each other.
They might possibly approach along a straight line;
but more probably some third aggregation, or some
distant sun, would deflect them into orbits about their
common centre of gravity, in which, by prolonged
collisions of cosmical matter, they are brought to
ultimate coalescence with each other. Or some other
attractive disturbance affords such a resultant of
actions as may bring them more directly together.
When these larger aggregations of world-stuff come
together, the result is an aggregation approaching
the dimensions of the Herschellian nebulæ.”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In regard to the origin of the heat of the nebulæ,
I am glad to find that Professor Winchell, to a certain
extent, adopts the views which I have so long entertained
on the subject. “The thought,” he says, “must
already have suggested itself to the reader that the
process of conglomeration affords an explanation of
the intense heat which vaporises its substance, and
causes it to yield a spectrum of bright lines. As the
sudden compression of a portion of atmospheric air
yields heat sufficient to ignite tinder, or fuse and
volatilise a descending meteor-mass, so the precipitation
of one planet upon another would liberate sufficient
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>heat to reduce them both to a state of fusion, or
even of vapour. Still more must the intensest heat
be generated by the impact of two nebulous masses,
one or both of which together may embrace more
matter than all our planets and the sun combined—as
much even as the matter of our entire visible firmament
of stars. One experiences a distinct feeling
of relief in the discovery of such a possible means of
ignition of nebulæ.”</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mr. Charles Morris on the pre-nebular condition
of matter.</i>—Others again suppose matter to be present
everywhere throughout space. This view has been
ingeniously advocated by Mr. Charles Morris in an
article on “The Matter of Space,” which appeared in
<i>Nature</i>, February 8, 1883. The hypothesis of an
ether specially distinct from matter he considers to
be a gratuitous assumption, and one of the last surviving
relics of eighteenth century science, and, unless
it can be proved that highly disintegrated matter is
positively incapable of conveying light vibrations,
there is no warrant for assigning this duty to a distinct
form of substance. But that matter exists in
outer space in the same conditions as in planetary
atmospheres he thinks is improbable. Its duty as a
conveyer of radiant vibrations seems to require a far
greater tensity, and its disintegration is probably extreme.
Assuming matter throughout the universe—here
as condensed spheres, and there in outer space
as highly rarified substance—the atmospheric envelopes
of the spheres, he considers, will gradually shade
off into the excessively rare matter of mid-space.
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>Matter may exist in countless conditions as to simplicity
and complexity, &amp;c., but the base particle he
assumes to be the same under all conditions. In the
spheres there is matter ranging from the simplest
elementary gases, through the mineral compounds of
the solid surface, to the highly compounded organic
molecules. In outer space the variation is in the
opposite direction; the matter existing there in a
highly disintegrated condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every particle he considers to possess a certain
amount of motor energy in the form of heat. As the
total amount of this energy in the universe remains
unchanged, a particle can only lose energy by transferring
it to others. This heat energy acts, of course,
in opposition to gravity: it tends to repel the particles
from each other, while gravity, on the other
hand, tends to draw them together. The former acts
as a centrifugal, the latter as a centripetal energy.
If the heat momentum of the particles be insufficient
to constitute a centrifugal energy equal to the centripetal
energy of gravitation, then the material contents
of space will be drawn into the attracting spheres as
atmospheric substance, and outer space, in this case,
will be left destitute of matter. If, on the contrary,
the centrifugal energy of the particles be sufficient to
resist gravitation, then the particles will remain free,
and space will continue to be occupied with matter.
As has been stated, the sum of motor energy in
the universe remaining unchanged, the aggregation
of atmospheric substance around any planet
resulting from the loss of motor energy must
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>cause an increase of motor energy in the particles
outside.</p>

<p class='c008'>The theory seems to dispense with the necessity
for assuming a luminiferous ether, for the functions
attributed to the ether may, it is thought, be performed
by the particles themselves; a view which has
been advocated by Euler, Grove, and others. The
origin of nebulæ, according to the theory, is accounted
for as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The nebular hypothesis,” says Mr. Morris, “holds
that the matter now concentrated into suns and
planets was once more widely disseminated, so that
the substance of each sphere occupied a very considerable
extent of space. It even declares that the
matter of the solar system was a nebulous cloud,
extending far beyond the present limits of that system.
From this original condition the existing condition of
the spheres has arisen through a continued concentration
of matter. But this concentration was constantly
opposed by the heat energy of the particles,
or, in other words, by their centrifugal momentum.
This momentum could only be got rid of by a redistribution
of motor energy. If, for illustration, the
average momentum of the particles of the nebulæ was
just equivalent to their gravitative energy, then a
portion of this energy must radiate or be conducted
outwards ere the internal particles could be held
prisoners by gravitation. The loss of momentum
inwardly must be correlated with an increase of
momentum outwardly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is a necessary consequence of the heat
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>relations of matter. As substance condenses, its capacity
for heat decreases and its temperature rises,
hence a difference of temperature must constantly
have arisen between the denser and the rarer portions
of the nebulous mass, and equality of temperature
could be restored only by heat radiation. This radiation
still continues, and must continue until condensation
ceases and the temperatures of the spheres
and space become equalised; but this is equivalent to
declaring that as the particles of the spheres decrease
in heat momentum those of interspheral space increase,
and if originally the centrifugal and centripetal
energies of matter approached equality they
must become unequal, centripetal energy becoming
in excess in spheral matter, centrifugal energy in the
matter of space. Thus, as a portion of the widely
distributed nebulous matter lost its heat, and became
permanently fixed in place by gravitative attraction,
another portion gained heat, became still more independent
of gravity, and assumed a state of greater
nebulous diffusion than originally. The condensing
spheres only denuded space of a portion of the matter
which it formerly held, and left the remainder more
thinly distributed than before. The spheres, in their
concentration, have emitted, and are emitting, a vast
energy of motion. This motor energy yet exists in
space as a motion of the particles of matter, which,
therefore, press upon each other, or seek to extend
their limits, with increasing vigour, so that the elasticity
of interspheral matter is constantly increasing.”</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Sir William R. Grove on the pre-nebular condition
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>of matter.</i>—Amongst the first to advocate the
view that ordinary matter is everywhere present in
space was Sir William R. Grove. In a lecture
delivered at the London Institution as far back as
January 1842, he stated that it appeared to him
that heat and light, according to the undulatory
theory, were the result of the vibrations of ordinary
matter itself, and not that of a distinct ethereal fluid.
Twenty years afterwards, referring to the views he
then advanced, he says: “Although this theory has
been considered defective by a philosopher of high
repute, I cannot see the force of the arguments by
which it has been assailed; and, therefore, for the
present, though with diffidence, I still adhere to it.”<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>He adduces a great many facts and forcible arguments
in support of his position. He says that
“there appears no reason why the atmosphere of the
different planets should not be, with reference to each
other, in a state of equilibrium. Ether, or the highly
attenuated matter existing in the interplanetary
space, being an expansion of some or all of these
atmospheres, or of the more volatile portions of them,
would thus furnish matter for the transmission of
the modes of motion which we call light, heat, &amp;c.”
It is assumed in the theory, of course, that matter
must form a universal planum.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir William Grove favours the idea that the universe
is illimitable in extent, a view held by many
eminent thinkers.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span><span class='sc'>Evolution of the Chemical Elements, and its Relations to Stellar Evolution.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>We come now to the consideration of a subject
which has a most important bearing on the question
of stellar evolution, viz. the genesis and dissociation
of the chemical elements. The evolution of one
element from another is, it is true, as yet but a mere
hypothesis, but it is an hypothesis well supported by
a host of facts and considerations, and held by a large
number of our leading chemists and physicists. “The
demonstrated unity of force,” says Professor F. W.
Clarke,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c015'><sup>[65]</sup></a> “leads us by analogy to expect a similar unity
of matter; and the many strange and hitherto unexplained
relations between the different elements
tend to encourage our expectations.” The hypothesis
throws much light on some obscure points in stellar
evolution. In regard to this, Professor Clarke justly
remarks that “it is plain that the nebular hypothesis
would be doubled in importance, and our views of the
universe greatly expanded, if it could be shown that
an evolution of complex from simple forms of matter
accompanied the development of planets from the
nebulæ. Evolution could look for no grander triumph.”
In fact, it is difficult to understand how our sun and
the stars could have been evolved from nebulæ without
assuming an evolution of the chemical elements. The
true nebulæ show the presence of only two elements,
nitrogen and hydrogen, but our sun contains more
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>than a dozen of distinct elements, and the planets
more than three times that number. How, then, could
all these have arisen out of nebulæ composed simply
of nitrogen and hydrogen? The matter is plain if we
assume an evolution of the elements.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stars have been classed into four groups,
which, as Professor Clarke has remarked, indicate
different stages in the process of evolution. The first
class, containing white stars like Sirius, show the predominance
of hydrogen and a scarcity of the metallic
elements. In the second class the metallic elements
become more numerous and the hydrogen less distinct;
while in the third class hydrogen is difficult to
detect.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a> This seems to show a gradual development
of the chemical elements as the star cools and grows
older. I shall now give a brief account of the views
expressed on the subject by some of our leading
physicists and chemists.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be observed, in reference to the theories we
have just considered, that the process of evolution is
supposed to take place from the smaller to the larger
aggregates of matter. Beginning with an extreme
condition of tenuity, by aggregation, the materials
become successively larger and more complex. In
passing backwards in the process we find the aggregates
becoming less and less till they reach the
“cosmical dust,” or “fire-mist,” out of which the
primitive nebulæ were supposed to be formed. Receding
still farther back, we have the universal
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>atmosphere from which the fire-mist is assumed to
have been derived.</p>

<p class='c008'>This universal atmosphere, though in a state of
extreme tenuity, is, as we shall see, supposed by some
to be in a more elemental form than anything revealed
to us in the laboratory. The suggestion of the dissociation
of the chemical elements and its application
to stellar physics was, I think, first advanced by Sir
Benjamin Brodie in 1866, and more fully in 1867. In
the latter year views similar were considered more
fully by Dr. T. Sterry Hunt. The question of the
dissociation of elements has been ably discussed by
Mr. Lockyer in his various writings. It has been
suggested by Mr. Lockyer that the coincidence of rays
emitted by different chemical elements when subjected
to very high temperatures affords evidence of a common
element in the composition of the metals producing
the coincident rays. Mr. Lockyer states that
many trains of thought suggested by solar and stellar
physics point to the hypothesis that the <i>elements
themselves, or at all events some of them, are compound
bodies</i>.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a> This view was also put forward by Professor
Graham, who says “that it is conceivable that the
various kinds of matter now recognised in different
elementary substances may possess one and the same
element or atomic molecule existing in different conditions
of mobility. The essential unity of matter,”
he adds, “is an hypothesis in harmony with the
equal action of gravity upon all bodies.” Similar
views have been advocated by M. Dumas, who based
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>the suggestion of the composite nature of the elementary
atoms on certain relations of atomic weights.
The composite nature of the chemical elements has
also been maintained by Henri Sainte-Claire Deville,
and also by Berthelot, who held that the atoms of the
elements are the same, and distinguished only by
their modes of motion. Professor Schuster, in a
paper read before the British Association in 1880,
supports the view of the dissociation of the chemical
elements.</p>

<p class='c008'>That all the purely physical sciences will one day
be brought under a few general laws and principles,
and the whole of the recognised chemical elements
will be resolved into one or two material elements, is
a conclusion towards which physical science seems at
present slowly tending. There is certainly something
fascinating in this view of the unity of nature.
There is in this idea more than a purely physical
interest attached to it. It has, as I hope to show
in a future work, an important bearing on questions
relating to the foundations of the true theory of
evolution.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question of the unity of the chemical elements
is one, however, yet in a hypothetical condition. Professors
Liveing and Dewar, who have given attention
to this subject, say: “The supposition that the different
elements may be resolved into simpler constituents, or
into a single one, has long been a favourite speculation
with chemists; but, however probable this hypothesis
may appear <i>à priori</i>, it must be acknowledged
that the facts derived from the most powerful method
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>of analytical investigation yet devised give it scant
support.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c015'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><i>Sir Benjamin Brodie on the pre-nebular condition of
matter.</i>—There are, considers Sir Benjamin Brodie,
very forcible reasons which lead us to suspect that
chemical substances are really composed of a primitive
system of elemental bodies, analogous in their
general nature to our present elements: that some of
those bodies which we speak of as elements may be
compounds. These ideal elements assumed by him,
he says, “though now revealed to us by the numerical
properties of chemical equations only as <i>implicit and
dependent existences</i>, we cannot but surmise may sometimes
become, or may in the past have been, <i>isolated
and independent existences</i>”—as, for instance, in the
case of the sun, where the temperature is excessive.
“We may,” he further adds, “consider that in remote
ages the temperature of matter was much higher than
it is now, and that these other things [ideal elements]
existed then in the state of perfect gases—separate
existences—uncombined.”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a> He then refers to certain
observations of Mr. Huggins and Dr. Miller on the
spectra of nebulæ where one of the lines of nitrogen
was found alone; and that this suggested to them that
the line might have been produced by one of the
elements of nitrogen; and that nitrogen may therefore
be compound. He mentions as a significant fact
that a large proportion of the class of elements which
he has termed “composite elements” has not been
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>found in the sun, they having probably been decomposed
by the intense heat.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Dr. T. Sterry Hunt on the pre-nebular condition of
matter.</i>—A year after the foregoing views regarding
chemical dissociation had been advanced by Sir
Benjamin Brodie, Dr. T. Sterry Hunt, in a lecture on
“The Chemistry of the Primeval Earth,” delivered at
the Royal Institution (May 31, 1867), put forward,
apparently quite independently, opinions on dissociation
similar to those of Brodie. In this lecture he
says: “I considered the chemistry of nebulæ, sun, and
stars in the combined light of spectroscopic analysis
and Deville’s researches on dissociation, and concluded
with the generalisation that the breaking-up
of compounds, or dissociation of elements, by intense
heat is a principle of universal application, so that
we may suppose that all the elements which make
up the sun, or our planet, would, when so intensely
heated as to be in the gaseous condition which all
matter is capable of assuming, remain uncombined,
that is to say, would exist together in the state
of chemical elements, whose further dissociation in
stellar or nebulous masses may even give us evidence
of matter still more elemental than that revealed in
the experiments of the laboratory, where we can only
conjecture the compound nature of many of the so-called
elementary substances.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c015'><sup>[70]</sup></a> And in his address
at the grave of Priestley he referred to the suggestion
of Lavoisier that hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen,
with heat and light, might be regarded as simpler
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>forms of matter from which all others are derived.
This suggestion was considered in connection with
the fact that the nebulæ, which we conceive to be
condensing into suns and planets, have hitherto
shown evidences only of the presence of the first
two of these elements, which, as is well known,
make up a large part of the gaseous envelope of our
planet, in the forms of air and aqueous vapour.
With this he connected the hypothesis advanced by
Grove, “that our atmosphere and ocean are but
portions of the universal medium which, in an attenuated
form, fills the interstellary spaces;<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c015'><sup>[71]</sup></a> and
further suggested as a legitimate and plausible
speculation that these same nebulæ and their resulting
worlds <i>may be evolved by a process of
chemical condensation from this universal atmosphere</i>,
to which they would sustain a relation somewhat
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>analogous to that of clouds and rain to the aqueous
vapour around us.”</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Professor Oliver Lodge on the pre-nebular condition
of matter.</i>—Some have gone still farther back and
supposed that the material universe may have arisen
out of the luminiferous ether—the hypothetical medium
which is assumed to pervade all space. The
universal world-stuff scattered through boundless
space may in an extreme state of attenuation be,
says Professor Winchell, the ethereal medium, and
out of this semi-spiritual substance may have germinated
the molecules of common matter. “It is certainly
possible,” he says, “to conceive these cosmical
atoms as a rising-out of some transformation of the
ethereal medium; but we know too little of the nature
of ether to ground a scientific inference of this kind.”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The ethereal origin of matter has been advocated
by M. Saigey, Dr. Macvicar, and others. In a lecture
by Professor Oliver Lodge, delivered at the London
Institution in December 1882, he also advocates
the ethereal origin of matter. “As far as we know,”
to state his views in his own words, “this ether
appears to be a perfectly homogeneous, incompressible,
continuous body, incapable of being resolved
into simple elements or atoms; it is, in fact, continuous,
not molecular. There is no other body of
which we can say this, and hence the properties of
ether must be somewhat different from those of
ordinary matter.” ... “One naturally asks, is there
any such clear distinction to be drawn between ether
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>and matter as we have hitherto tacitly assumed?
May they not be different modifications, or even
manifestations, of the same thing?” He then adopts
Sir William Thomson’s theory of vortex atoms, into
the details of which I need not here enter. In conclusion,
says Professor Lodge, “I have now endeavoured
to introduce you to the simplest conception of
the material universe which has yet occurred to man—the
conception that it is of one universal substance,
perfectly homogeneous and continuous, and simple in
structure, extending to the farthest limits of space of
which we have any knowledge, existing equally everywhere:
some portions either at rest or in simple irrotational
motion, transmitting the undulations which
we call light; other portions in rotational motion—in
vortices, that is—and differentiated permanently from
the rest of the medium by reason of this motion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“These whirling portions constitute what we call
matter; their motion gives them rigidity, and of them
our bodies and all other material bodies with which
we are acquainted are built up.</p>

<p class='c008'>“One continuous substance filling all space, which
can vibrate as light; which can be sheared into positive
and negative electricity; which in whirls constitutes
matter; and which transmits by continuity, and
not by impact, every action and reaction of which
matter is capable. This is the modern view of ether
and its functions.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c015'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>There is this objection to Professor Lodge’s theory:
it is purely hypothetical. The vortex atoms are not
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>only hypothetical, but the substance out of which these
atoms are assumed to be formed is also itself hypothetical.
We have no certain evidence that such a
medium as is thus supposed exists, or that a medium
possessing the qualities attributed to it could exist.
In fact, we have here one hypothesis built upon
another.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vortex theory appears to me to be beset by a
difficulty of another kind, viz. that of reconciling it
with the First Law of Motion. According to that law no
body possessing inertia can deviate from the straight
line unless forced to do so. A planet will not move
round the sun unless it be constantly acted upon by a
force deflecting it from the straight path. A grindstone
will not rotate on its axis unless its particles
are held together by a force preventing them from
flying off at a tangent to the curve in which they are
moving. Centrifugal force must always be balanced
by centripetal force. The difficulty is to understand
what force counterbalances the centrifugal force of
the rotating material of the vortex-atom. It is not
because the centrifugal tendency of the rotating
material is controlled by the exterior incompressible
fluid, for it offers no resistance whatever to the
passage of the atom through it—in short, in so
far as the motion of the atom is concerned, this
fluid is a perfect void. Now, if this fluid can offer no
resistance to the passage of the atom as a whole, how
then does it manage to offer such enormous resistance
to the materials composing the atom, so as to continually
deflect them from the straight path and
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>compel them to move in a curve? The centrifugal
force of these vortex-atoms must be enormous, for on
it is assumed to depend the hardness or resistance of
matter to pressure. Now the centripetal force which
balances this centrifugal force must be equally enormous.
If, then, this perfect fluid outside the vortex-atom
can exert this enormous force on the revolving
material without being itself possessed of vortex-motion,
there does not seem to be any necessity
for vortex-motion in order to produce resistance. In
short, how is the existence of the atom possible under
the physical conditions assumed in the theory?
How this may be, like the space of four dimensions,
may be expressed in mathematical language, but
like it, I fear, it is unthinkable as a physical conception.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Mr. William Crookes on the pre-nebular condition of
matter.</i>—In his opening address before the Chemical
Section of the British Association in 1886, Mr. William
Crookes entered at considerable length into the question
of the genesis and evolution of the chemical
elements. I shall here give a brief statement of his
views as embodied in his important address, and this
I shall endeavour to do as nearly as possible in Mr.
Crookes’s own words.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We ask,” says Mr. Crookes, “whether the chemical
elements may not have been evolved from a few antecedent
forms of matter—or possibly from only one
such—just as it is now held that all the innumerable
variations of plants and animals have been developed
from fewer and earlier forms of organic life: built up,
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>as Dr. Gladstone remarks, from one another according
to some general plan. This building up, or evolution,
is above all things not fortuitous: the variation and
development which we recognise in the universe run
along certain fixed lines which have been preconceived
and foreordained. To the careless and hasty eye
design and evolution seem antagonistic; the more
careful inquirer sees that evolution, steadily proceeding
along an ascending scale of excellence, is the strongest
argument in favour of a preconceived plan.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, as in the organic world, so in the inorganic,
it seems natural to view the chemical elements not as
primordial, but as the gradual outcome of a process
of development, possibly even of a struggle for existence.
But this evolution of the elements must have
taken place at a period so remote as to be difficult to
grasp by the imagination, when our earth, or rather
the matter of which it consists, was in a state very
different from its present condition. The epoch of
elemental development, remarks Mr. Crookes, is decidedly
over, and it may be observed that in the
opinion of not a few biologists the epoch of organic
development is verging upon its close.</p>

<p class='c008'>Is there then, in the first place, any direct evidence
of the transmutation of any supposed “element” of
our existing list into another, or of its resolution into
anything simpler? To this question Mr. Crookes
answers in the negative.</p>

<p class='c008'>We find ourselves thus driven to indirect evidence—to
that which we may glean from the mutual relations
of the elementary bodies. First, we may consider
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>the conclusion arrived at by Herschel, and pursued by
Clerk-Maxwell, that atoms bear the impress of manufactured
articles. “A manufactured article may well
be supposed to involve a manufacturer. But it does
something more: it implies certainly a raw material,
and probably, though not certainly, the existence of by-products,
residues, paraleipomena. What or where is
here the raw material? Can we detect any form of
matter which bears to the chemical elements a relation
like that of a raw material to the finished product, like
that, say, of coal-tar to alizarin? Or can we recognise
any elementary bodies which seem like waste or refuse?
Or are all the elements, according to the common
view, co-equals? To these questions no direct answers
are forthcoming.”</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Argument from Prout’s Law.</i>—The bearing of the
hypothesis of Prout in relation to the evolution of the
elements is first considered by Mr. Crookes. If that
hypothesis were demonstrated it would show that the
accepted elements are not co-equal, but have been
formed by a process of expansion or evolution. According
to this hypothesis the atomic weights of the
elements are multiples by a series of whole numbers
of the atomic weight of hydrogen. It is true that
accurate determinations of the atomic weights of different
elements do not by any means harmonise with the
values which Prout’s Law requires; nevertheless the
agreement in so many cases is so close that one can
scarcely regard the coincidence as accidental.</p>

<p class='c008'>The atomic weights have been recalculated with
extreme care by Professor F. W. Clarke, of Cincinnati,
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>and he says that “none of the seeming exceptions
are inexplicable. In short, admitting half-multiples
as legitimate, it is more probable that the few apparent
exceptions are due to undetected constant errors
than that the great number of close agreements should
be merely accidental.” In reference to this suggestion
of Professor Clarke, Mr. Crookes thinks that it places
the matter upon an entirely new basis. For, suppose
the unit atom to be not hydrogen, but some element
of still lower atomic weight, say <i>helium</i>, an element
supposed by many authorities to exist in the sun
and other stellar bodies—an element whose spectrum
consists of a single ray, and whose vapour possesses
no absorbent power, which indicates a remarkable
simplicity of molecular constitution. Granting that
helium exists, all analogy points, says Mr. Crookes, to
its atomic weight being below that of hydrogen; and
here, then, we have the very element with atomic
weight half that of hydrogen required by Professor
Clarke as the basis of Prout’s Law.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Argument from the earth’s crust.</i>—The probable
compound nature of the chemical elements, Mr.
Crookes thinks, is better shown by a consideration of
certain peculiarities in their occurrence in the earth’s
crust. “We do not,” he says, “find them evenly distributed
throughout the globe. Nor are they associated
in accordance with their specific gravities:
the lighter elements placed on or near the surface,
and the heavier ones following serially deeper and
deeper. Neither can we trace any distinct relation
between local climate and mineral distribution. And
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>by no means can we say that elements are always or
chiefly associated in nature in the order of their so-called
chemical affinities: those which have a strong
tendency to form with each other definite chemical
combinations being found together, whilst those which
have little or no such tendency exist apart. We certainly
find calcium as carbonate and sulphate, sodium
as chloride, silver and lead as sulphides; but why do
we find certain groups of elements, with little affinity
for each other, yet existing in juxtaposition or commixture?”</p>

<p class='c008'>As instances of such grouping he mentions nickel
and cobalt; the two groups of platinum metals; and
the so-called “rare earths,” existing in gadolinite,
samarskite, &amp;c. Why, then, are these elements so
closely associated? What agency has brought them
together? It cannot be considered that nickel and
cobalt have been deposited in admixture by organic
agency; nor yet the groups of iridium, osmium, and
platinum; ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium.</p>

<p class='c008'>These features, Mr. Crookes thinks, seem to point
to their formation severally from some common
material placed in conditions in each case nearly
identical.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Argument from the compound radicals.</i>—A strong
argument in favour of the compound nature of the
elements, Mr. Crookes thinks, is derived from a consideration
of their analogy to the compound radicals,
or pseudo-elements as they might be called. It may
be fairly held that if a body known to be compound
is found behaving as an element, this fact lends
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>plausibility to the supposition that the elements
are not absolutely simple. From a comparison of
the physical properties of inorganic with those of
organic compounds, Dr. Carnelley concluded that the
elements, as a whole, are analogous to the hydrocarbon
radicals. This conclusion, if true, he added,
should lead to the further inference that the so-called
elements are not truly elementary, but are made up
of at least two absolute elements, which he named
provisionally A and B.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Dr. Carnelley’s scheme all the chemical elements
save hydrogen are supposed to be composed of two
simpler elements, A = 12 and B = 2. Of these he regards
A as a tetrad identical with carbon, and B as a
monad of negative weight; perhaps the ethereal fluid
of space. His three primary elements are, therefore,
carbon, hydrogen, and the ether.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Argument from polymerisation.</i>—The polymeristic
theory of the genesis of the chemical elements propounded
by Dr. Mills falls next to be considered.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been suggested by Dr. E. J. Mills that the
pristine matter was once in an intensely heated condition,
and that it has reached its present state by a
process of free cooling, and that the elements, as we
now have them, are the result of successive polymerisations.
Chemical substances in cooling naturally
increase in density, and we sometimes observe that as
the density increases there are critical points corresponding
to the formation of new and well-defined
substances. The bodies thus formed are known as
polymers. From a study of the classification of the
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>elements Mr. Mills is of opinion that the only known
polymers of the primitive matter are arsenic, antimony,
and perhaps erbium and osmium.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Argument from the Periodic Law.</i>—Lastly a scheme
of the origin of the elements, suggested to Mr. Crookes
by consideration of Professor Reynolds’s method of
illustrating the periodic law of Newlands, is discussed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was pointed out by Newlands that atomicity
and other properties of some of the chemical elements
depend on the order in which their atomic weights
succeeded one another; and when this law was extended
by Professor Mendelejeff to all elements it was
apparent that a mathematical relation exists between
the elements. This far-reaching law has been fruitful
of results. Referring to Professor Reynolds’s diagram
illustrating the law, Mr. Crookes says: “The more I
study the arrangement of this zigzag curve, the more
I am convinced that he who grasps the key will be
permitted to unlock some of the deepest mysteries of
creation. Let us imagine if it is possible to get a
glimpse of a few of the secrets here hidden. Let us
picture the very beginnings of time, before geological
ages, before the earth was thrown off from the central
nucleus of molten fluid, before even the sun himself
had consolidated from the original <i>protyle</i>.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c015'><sup>[74]</sup></a> Let us
still imagine that at this primal stage all was in an
ultra-gaseous state, at a temperature inconceivably
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>hotter than anything now existing in the visible universe;
so high, indeed, that the chemical atoms could
not yet have been formed, being still far above their
dissociation-point. In so far as <i>protyle</i> is capable of
radiating or reflecting light, this vast sea of incandescent
mist, to an astronomer in a distant star,
might have appeared as a nebula, showing in the
spectroscope a few isolated lines, forecasts of hydrogen,
carbon, and nitrogen spectra.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But in course of time some process akin to cooling,
probably internal, reduces the temperature of the
cosmic <i>protyle</i> to a point at which the first step in
granulation takes place; matter as we know it comes
into existence, and atoms are formed. As soon as an
atom is formed out of <i>protyle</i> it is a store of energy,
potential (from its tendency to coalesce with other
atoms by gravitation or chemically) and kinetic (from
its internal motions). To obtain this energy, the
neighbouring <i>protyle</i> must be refrigerated by it, and
thereby the subsequent formation of other atoms will
be accelerated. But with atomic matter the various
forms of energy which require matter to render them
evident begin to act; and, amongst others, that form
of energy which has for one of its factors what we
now call <i>atomic weight</i>. Let us assume that the
elementary <i>protyle</i> contains within itself the potentiality
of every possible combining proportion or
atomic weight. Let it be granted that the whole of
our known elements were not at this epoch simultaneously
created. The easiest formed element, the
one most nearly allied to the <i>protyle</i> in simplicity, is
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>first born. Hydrogen—or shall we say helium?—of all
the known elements the one of simplest structure and
lowest atomic weight, is the first to come into being.
For some time hydrogen would be the only form of
matter (as we know it) in existence, and between
hydrogen and the next formed element there would be
a considerable gap in time, during the latter part of
which the element next in order of simplicity would
be slowly approaching its birth-point: pending this
period we may suppose that the evolutionary process,
which soon was to determine the birth of a new
element, would also determine its atomic weight, its
affinities, and its chemical position.”</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Professor F. W. Clarke on the pre-nebular condition
of matter.</i>—Views on elemental evolution almost
similar to those of Mr. Crookes’s have been advocated
by Professor Clarke. Spectroscopic phenomena, says
Professor Clarke, are quite in harmony with the idea
that all matter is at bottom one, our supposed atoms
being really various aggregations of the same fundamental
unit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Everybody knows that the nebular hypothesis, as
it is to-day, draws its strongest support from spectroscopic
facts. There shine the nebulæ in the heavens,
and the spectroscope tells us what they really are,
namely, vast clouds of incandescent gas, mainly, if not
entirely, hydrogen and nitrogen. If we attempt to
trace the chain of evolution through which our planet
is supposed to have grown, we shall find the sky is
full of intermediate forms. The nebulæ themselves
appear to be in various stages of development; the
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>fixed stars or suns differ widely in chemical constitution
and in temperature; our earth is most complex
of all. There are no ‘missing links’ such as
the zoologist longs to discover when he tries to explain
the origin of species. First, we have a nebula
containing little more than hydrogen, then a very hot
star with calcium, magnesium, and one or two other
metals added; next comes a cooler sun in which free
hydrogen is missing, but whose chemical complexity
is much increased; at last we reach the true planets
with their multitudes of material forms. Could there
well be a more straightforward story? Could the
unity of creation receive a much more ringing emphasis?
We see the evolution of planets from
nebulæ still going on, and parallel with it an evolution
of higher from lower kinds of matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Just here, perhaps, is the key to the whole subject.
If the elements are all in essence one, how
could their many forms originate save by a process
of evolution upward? How could their numerous
relations with each other, and their regular serial arrangements
into groups, be better explained? In this,
as in other problems, the hypothesis of evolution is
the simplest, most natural, and best in accordance
with facts.”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c015'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><i>Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney on the pre-nebular condition
of matter.</i>—Further evidence that all the chemical
elements were probably evolved from one common
source, is furnished by Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney’s
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>“Logarithmic Law of Atomic Weights,” a theory
recently advanced in a communication to the Royal
Society.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c015'><sup>[76]</sup></a> A cardinal feature of this investigation is
that in it atomic weights are represented by volumes,
not by lines. A succession of spheres are taken whose
volumes are proportional to the atomic weights, and
which may be called <i>the atomic spheres</i>. When the
radii of these spheres are plotted down on a diagram
as ordinates, and a series of integers as abscissas, the
general form of the logarithmic curve becomes apparent;
and close scrutiny has shown that either the
logarithmic curve, or some curve lying very close to
it, expresses the real law of nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, as seems probable, the logarithmic law is the
law of nature, there appear to be three elements
lighter than hydrogen, which Dr. Stoney has termed
infra-fluorine, infra-oxygen, and infra-nitrogen. And
there are, at all events, six missing elements between
hydrogen and lithium.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Stoney’s investigation is based on the fact that
if the atomic weights of the chemical elements be
arranged in order of magnitude, periodic laws come
to light, viz.: those discovered by Newlands, Mendelejeff,
and Meyer. From this it follows that there
must be some law connecting the atomic weights with
the successive terms of a numerical series—either
alone or along with other variables.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This law,” says Dr. Stoney, “may be obtained in
one of its graphical forms by plotting down a series
of integers as abscissas, and the successive atomic
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>weights as ordinates. In this way it furnishes a diagram
which has somewhat the shape of a hurling-stick,
consisting of a short curved portion succeeded by
a long and nearly straight portion. But as this diagram
cannot be directly identified with any known curve,
it does not suffice for the determination of the law.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The diagram, however, assumes a form which can
be interpreted when we use the cube roots of the
atomic weights for its ordinates, instead of the atomic
weights themselves. This is equivalent to taking
volumes instead of lines to represent the atomic
weights. When this is done, the ends of the ordinates
are found to lie near a regular and gradual curve,
from which they deviate to the right and left by displacements
that are small and appear to follow periodic
laws which have been in part traced. The central
curve is found on examination to be either a logarithmic
curve or some curve lying exceedingly close to it.
If the curve be in reality the logarithmic curve, it
furnishes us the law that:</p>

<p class='c008'>“The cube root of the n<sup>th</sup> atomic weight = κ log (n q)
+ a small periodic correction; where κ and q are
constants, the values of which are furnished by the
observations.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Either this logarithmic law, or a law that lies exceedingly
close to it, must be the law of nature.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Referring to this theory, Professor Reynolds says:
“It certainly introduced points of extraordinary importance,
though perhaps at present they could not all
quite realise its fullest import. There were several
points of some little difficulty to be grappled with, but
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>it clearly pointed to the conclusion that we were fast
approaching the time when physicists—both chemical
and physicists proper—are combining to evolve out of
the scientific work lying on the borderland most important
and startling facts.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The bearing which Dr. Stoney’s conclusions, like
those of Mr. Crookes, have on the primitive condition
of the material universe is obvious.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Stoney, like Mr. Crookes, considers that the
chemical elements are subject to decay. That they
are not only generated but destroyed—that they are
subject not only to evolution but dissolution. He
believes that the generative process probably takes
place only at, or beyond, the confines of the universe,
and the destructive process at the centres of overgrown
stars, which is the position of lowest potential. Dr.
Stoney thinks that this extinction of the chemical
elements in the centre of a star is a cause which
limits its size and prevents its overgrowth.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c014'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Impact Theory in relation to the foregoing Theories of the Pre-nebular Condition of Matter.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In all these theories, as has already been observed,
the primitive condition of the universe was that
of matter in a state of extreme tenuity, while by
aggregation the materials became successively larger
and larger until they assumed the magnitude of suns
and planets. For example, according to the meteoric
theory, meteorites are formed out of “cosmical dust,”
“fire-mist,” or condensed vapour, and then suns
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>and planets are formed by aggregation from these
meteorites. Facts seem, however, to point to the
very reverse as being the true course of events.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meteorites are undoubtedly the fragments of
larger masses. It looks more likely that they are,
as has already been stated, fragments of stellar
masses which have been shattered to pieces by
collision, and that this “cosmical dust,” from which
the meteorites are alleged to have been formed, are
simply the dust arising out of the destruction of the
masses. After the two bodies had collided and been
shattered to pieces, some of the fragments would undoubtedly
be projected with a velocity that would
carry them beyond the attractive power of the general
mass, and thus they would escape being volatilised.
These fragments would continue their wanderings
through space as meteorites.</p>

<p class='c008'>I cannot but think that the number, as well as
the importance, of these wanderers has been greatly
over-estimated. Mr. Lockyer states that Dr. Schmidt,
of Athens, found that the mean hourly number of
luminous meteors visible on a clear moonless night
by one observer was fourteen. Certainly no such
quantity is visible in this country. In Scotland, at
least, one may often watch night after night under
the most favourable conditions without having the
good fortune to see a single meteor.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is, of course, true that the immediately prior
condition of a sun or a planet was that of matter in
an extremely attenuated or dissociated state. This
is essential to the nebular, as well as to the meteoric,
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>hypothesis. But it is not with the immediately prior
condition that we are at present concerned, but with
the primitive, or pre-nebular, condition. Take, for
example, the case of the solar nebula, out of which
our sun and planets were formed. Was this nebulous
mass formed from matter in a state of extreme
tenuity, scattered through space and collected together
by gravity? Or did it result from two solid
globes shattered to pieces by collision, which were
then converted into the nebulous condition by the
heat generated from the collision? It is no doubt
true that the analogies of nature would, at first sight,
be apt to lead us to the conclusion that the former
theory was the more likely of the two, as the larger
is generally made by aggregation from the smaller.
But a little consideration will show that, in the
present case, the weight of this analogy is more
apparent than real. The impact theory does not rest
upon a purely hypothetical basis. The cause to which
it appeals has a real existence. The point of uncertainty
is whether the cause actually produces the
effect which is attributed to it. We know from
observation that there are stellar masses, some of
them probably larger than our sun, moving through
space with enormous velocities in all directions.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c015'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
According to the ordinary laws of chance, collision at
times would be an inevitable result, and when such
an event did take place the destruction of the colliding
bodies, and their consequent transformation into a
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>nebulous mass, would, at least in many cases, be a
<i>necessary</i> result. In fact, we have, in the case of
these vast stellar masses, what we know occurs among
the invisible molecules of a gas. So far as mere
analogy is concerned, the impact theory is just about
as probable as the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>From what has been stated it would follow that in
most cases the stellar masses have been formed out
of the destruction of pre-existing masses, like the
geological formations out of the destruction of prior
formations.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The theories do not account for the motion of the
stars.</i>—According to all the foregoing theories aggregation
and condensation are produced by gravity.
The materials dispersed throughout space are drawn
together by their mutual attraction, and aggregated
round a centre of gravity. Gravitation, although it
imparts motion to the materials, can impart no motion
of translation to the mass itself. Gravitation cannot,
therefore, be the cause of the motion of translation of
the mass. The stars are not supposed to be gravitating
towards, or around, a great centre of attraction,
for they are found moving in straight lines in all
directions, which could not be the case if gravity were
the cause of their motion. To what cause is their
motion, therefore, to be attributed? A meteorite or
other small body might be ejected from any system,
by the explosive force of heat or some other cause,
with a velocity which might carry it into boundless
space; but such could not be the case in regard to a
body of the magnitude of a star. No one for a moment
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>could suppose that 1830 Groombridge, for example,
moving at the rate of 200 miles a second, is an eject
from any system.</p>

<p class='c008'>According to the impact theory the whole is plain;
for this 200 miles per second is simply a part of the
untransformed motion of translation which the materials
composing the star had from the beginning. In
other words, the matter and the motion were eternal,
or, what is more probable, as will afterwards be seen,
co-existed from creation—not, however, as molecular
motion, but as motion of the mass.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>The theories do not account for the amount of heat
required.</i>—It has been shown that, although the
materials of our solar system had fallen together from
an infinite distance, it could not have generated heat
sufficient to have formed a gaseous nebula extending
to the distance of the planet Neptune. Gravitation
alone could not, therefore, have been the source from
which the nebula obtained its heat. The solar nebula,
however, must originally have extended far beyond
the orbit of Neptune.</p>

<p class='c008'>But supposing it could be demonstrated that the
heat thus generated was sufficient to have formed a
nebula extending to even twice the distance of Neptune,
this would not remove the fatal objection to the
gravitation theory of the origin of the solar nebula.
For the facts, both of geology and of biology, equally
show that the sun has been radiating his heat at
the present rate for more than twice the length of
time that it could possibly have done had gravitation
been the source from which the energy was derived.
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>This objection is alike fatal to the meteoric theory as
it is to all other theories which attribute the origin
and source of the heat to gravitation.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Evolution of matter.</i>—Our inquiries into stellar
evolution do not, however, begin with the consideration
of a gaseous nebula, or with swarms of meteorites.
There was a pre-nebular evolution. The researches
of Prout, Newlands, Mendelejeff, Meyer, Dumas,
Clarke, Lockyer, Crookes, Brodie, Hunt, Graham,
Deville, Berthelot, Stoney, Reynolds, Carnelley, Mills,
and others, clearly show, I think, that the very matter
forming this nebulous mass passed through a long
anterior process of evolution. And not only the
matter, but the very elements themselves constituting
the matter, were evolved out of some prior condition
of substance.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have already given at some length the views
which have been advanced by several of our leading
physicists and chemists on the evolution of the chemical
elements, and on some of the bearings which these
views have on stellar evolution. I shall now briefly
refer to a point on which I venture to think the
theory discussed in this volume seems to cast some
additional light.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the elements were evolved out of a common
source, there is, in order to this, one necessary condition,
viz. an excessively high temperature; for the
temperature must be above the point of the dissociation
of all the chemical elements. “In the primal
stage of the universe,” says Mr. Crookes, “before
matter, as we now find it, was formed from the protyle,
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>all was in an ultra-gaseous state, at a temperature
inconceivably hotter than anything now existing in
the visible universe; so high, indeed, that the chemical
atoms could not yet have been formed, being still
far above their dissociation point.”</p>

<p class='c008'>What, then, produced this excessive temperature
in this supposed ultra-gaseous protyle? It could not
have resulted from condensation by gravity. In condensation
the heat increases as the condensation
proceeds, because it is the condensation which produces
the heat. But here the reverse must have been
the case, for the ultra-gaseous mass was much hotter
than the sun which was afterwards formed out of it.
It was, according to Mr. Crookes, when this gaseous
mass cooled down, so as to permit of its becoming converted
into solid matter, that condensation into a sun
could take place. Besides, was it not the excessive heat
which produced the assumed ultra-gaseous condition?</p>

<p class='c008'>There is another difficulty besetting the theory
that the primitive heat was derived from condensation
by gravitation. Supposing we should assume it possible
that the protyle could exist in this ultra-gaseous
state without possessing temperature, and that it obtained
its heat from condensation by gravity, then the
fact of condensation taking place shows that the gas
was not in a state of equilibrium. But the gas could
not have remained stationary for a single moment
without beginning to condense while in a condition of
unstable equilibrium. We must therefore conclude
that the gas must have been in some other condition
than the gaseous state prior to condensation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>The impact theory seems to remove all these difficulties.
It is just as likely <i>à priori</i>, if not more so,
that the primitive form of the protyle should have been
that of large cold masses moving through space in all
directions, with excessive velocities, as that it should
have been that of a gaseous mass in a state of unstable
equilibrium. If we assume the former condition, then
the colliding of these masses would account not only
for the ultra-gaseous state, but also for its inconceivably
high temperature. Besides, in this case we
are not called upon to account for any other antecedent
state of the masses before collision, for they may have
existed from the beginning of creation in the form of
masses in motion through space.</p>

<p class='c008'>Had space and time permitted, it might have been
shown that there are other obscure points on which
the theory seems to shed additional light. I shall
now, in conclusion, refer to a point wherein the
theory differs radically from that of all other theories
of stellar evolution. But before doing so I may
briefly refer to an objection which has been frequently
urged against the theory.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Objection considered.</i>—The objection to which I
refer is this, that, had the nebulæ been produced by
impact in the way implied in the theory, then we
ought to have had some historical record of such an
event. I can perceive no force in such an objection.
Our historical records, I presume, do not extend much
farther back than about 3,000 years, and we have
no evidence to conclude that a new nebula makes its
appearance in the visible firmament with such frequency;
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>and supposing it did, we have no grounds
for assuming that its production by impact in the
way supposed by the theory would attract general
notice. It is doubtful if the nebula produced
would, in the first instance, be actually visible. I
have shown that the temperature of the nebula could
not have been less than about 300,000,000° C., and
it is very doubtful if the gaseous mass enveloping all
that was solid in the nebula would, at such a temperature,
be self-luminous. The probability is that
all the chemical elements composing it would be in
a state of utter dissociation, and converted back into
the original protyle from which they were derived,
again to be slowly reconverted into their former
atomic condition as the temperature fell.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Can we on scientific grounds trace back the evolution
of the universe to an absolute first condition?</i>—As
has been repeatedly stated, all inquiries into the
evolutionary history of the stellar universe begin in
the middle of a process. Evolution is a process.
The changes that now occur arose out of preceding
changes, and these, preceding changes out of changes
still prior, and so on indefinitely back into the unknown
past. This chain of causation—this succession
of change—of consequent and antecedent—could not
in this manner have extended back to infinity, or else
the present stage of the universe’s evolution ought to
have been reached infinite ages ago. The evolution
of things must therefore have had a beginning in
time. Professor Winchell, in his final generalisation
to his work, “World Life,” has stated this matter so
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>clearly and forcibly that I cannot do better than here
quote his words on the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have not,” says Professor Winchell, “the
slightest scientific grounds for assuming that matter
existed in a certain condition from all eternity, and
only began undergoing its changes a few millions or
billions of years ago. The essential activity of the
powers ascribed to it forbids the thought. For all
that we know—and, indeed, as the <i>conclusion</i> from all
that we know—primal matter began its progressive
changes on the morning of its existence. As, therefore,
the series of changes is demonstrably finite, the lifetime
of matter itself is necessarily finite. There is no
real refuge from this conclusion; for, if we suppose
the beginning of the present cycle to have been only a
restitution of an older order effected by the operations
of natural causes, and suppose—what science is unable
to comprehend—that older order to be a similar re-inauguration,
and so on indefinitely through the past,
we only postpone the predication of an absolute beginning,
since, by all the admissions of modern scientific
philosophy, it is a necessity of nature to run down.”</p>

<p class='c008'>These are consequences which necessarily follow
from every theory of stellar evolution which has
hitherto been advanced. The impact theory, however,
completely removes the difficulty, for according
to it the evolutionary process can, on purely scientific
grounds, be traced back to an absolute beginning in
time. If huge solid masses moving through space were
the original condition of the universe, then, in so far
as either philosophy or science can demonstrate to the
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>contrary, it might have been in this condition from all
eternity. We are therefore not called upon to account
for this primitive condition of things. Now it is evident,
unless a collision should take place, the universe
would remain in this condition for ever: without a
collision there could be no change, no work performed,
and absolutely no loss or gain of energy, and therefore
no process of evolution. The first collision would be
the absolute commencement of evolution—the beginning
of the process of the development of the universe.
Evolution would, in this case, have its absolute beginning
in time, and consequently was not eternal. If, on
the other hand, we assume, what is far more in harmony
with physics, metaphysics, and common sense,
that the universe was created in time, we are still led
to the same result as to an absolute commencement of
evolution. In both cases we reach a point beyond
which there can be no legitimate inquiry; no further
question which the scientists can reasonably ask.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have no grounds to conclude that there is
anything eternal, except God, Time, and Space. But if
time and space be subjective, as Kant supposes, and
not modes pertaining to the existence of things in
themselves, then God alone was uncreated, and <i>of</i> Him
and <i>to</i> Him are all things.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='label'><a href='#r39'>39</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have been informed by Mr. Peach that since the above was written additional light has been cast on this immense fault. It has been found, he says, that the fault consists of two sub-parallel branches, the more southerly of which has the effect of bringing the rocks of the Upper Silurian age against the Lower Silurian beds. The northern branch brings the upper division of the Lower Old Red Sandstones, in turn, against the Upper Silurian rocks. This, Mr. Peach remarks, does not in the least invalidate the reasoning as to the amount of material removed by denudation from this region in the time specified. In fact, it shows, he says, that a greater amount must have been removed than was at first suspected.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='label'><a href='#r71'>71</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“Our atmosphere,” says Dr. Hunt, “is not terrestrial, but cosmical, being a universal medium diffused throughout all space, but condensed around the various centres of attraction in amount proportional to their mass and temperature, the waters of the ocean themselves belonging to this universal atmosphere.” (<i>Nature</i>, August 29, 1878, p. 475.) Similar views have been advocated by Mr. Mattieu Williams, who says “that the gaseous ocean, in which we are immersed, is but a portion of the infinite atmosphere that fills the whole solidity of space; that links together all the elements of the universe, and diffuses among them their heat and light, and all the other physical and vital forces which heat and light are capable of generating.” (<i>Fuel of the Sun</i>, p. 5.) In 1854 Sir William Thomson suggested the idea that the luminiferous ether was probably a continuation of our atmosphere, though I do not think he continues to hold that opinion. The first to advance this idea was, undoubtedly, Newton, who assumed interplanetary space to be universally filled with an ethereal medium “much of the same constitution as air, but far rarer, subtler, and more elastic.”</p>

<p class='drop-capanf0_3_0_7 c021'><b>DISCUSSIONS ON CLIMATE AND COSMOLOGY.</b> By
<span class='sc'>James Croll, LL. D., F. R. S.</span> With Chart. 12mo. Cloth, $2.00.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Contents</span>: Misapprehensions regarding the Physical Theory of Secular
Changes of Climate.—The Ice of Greenland and the Antarctic Continent not due
to Elevation of the Land.—Mr. Alfred R. Wallace’s Modification of the Physical
Theory or Secular Changes of Climate.—The Physical Cause of Mild Polar Climates.—Interglacial
Periods and Distribution of Flora and Fauna in Arctic
Regions.—Temperature of Space and its Bearing on Terrestrial Physics.—Probable
Origin and Age of the Sun’s Heat, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>CLIMATE AND TIME IN THEIR GEOLOGICAL RELATIONS:</b>
A THEORY OF SECULAR CHANGES OF THE
EARTH’S CLIMATE. By <span class='sc'>James Croll</span>, of H. M. Geological Survey
of Scotland. With Maps and Illustrations. 12mo. Cloth, $2.50.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have studiously avoided introducing anything of a hypothetical character.
All the conclusions are based on known facts or admitted physical principles.
In short, the aim of the work is to prove that secular changes of climate follow,
as a necessary effect, from admitted physical agencies, and that these changes,
in as far as the past climatic condition of the globe is concerned, fully meet the
demand of the geologist.”—<i>From the Preface.</i></p>

<p class='c021'><b>OTHER WORLDS THAN OURS:</b> THE PLURALITY OF
WORLDS, STUDIED UNDER THE LIGHT OF RECENT SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCHES. By <span class='sc'>Richard Anthony Proctor</span>. With
Illustrations, some colored. 12mo. Cloth, $2.50.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>LIGHT SCIENCE FOR LEISURE HOURS.</b> A Series of
Familiar Essays on Scientific Subjects, Natural Phenomena, etc. By
<span class='sc'>Richard Anthony Proctor</span>. 12mo. Cloth, $1.75.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>THE MOON:</b> HER MOTIONS, ASPECT, SCENERY, AND PHYSICAL
CONDITIONS. With Three Lunar Photographs, and many
Plates, Charts, etc. By <span class='sc'>Richard Anthony Proctor</span>. 8vo. Cloth,
$3.50.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>THE EXPANSE OF HEAVEN.</b> A Series of Essays on the
Wonders of the Firmament. By <span class='sc'>Richard Anthony Proctor</span>.
12mo. Cloth, $2.00.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>OUR PLACE AMONG INFINITIES.</b> A Series of Essays contrasting
our Little Abode in Space and Time with the Infinities
around us. To which are added Essays on the Jewish Sabbath and
Astrology. By <span class='sc'>Richard Anthony Proctor</span>. 12mo. Cloth, $1.75.</p>

<p class='c021'><b>PHYSICAL EXPRESSION: Its Modes and Principles.</b> By
<span class='sc'>Francis Warner</span>, M. D., Assistant Physician, and Lecturer on Botany,
to the London Hospital, etc. With 51 Illustrations. 12mo.
Cloth, $1.75.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the term ‘Physical Expression,’ Dr. Warner included all those changes of form
and feature occurring in the body which may be interpreted as evidences of mental
action. At first thought it would seem that facial expression is the most important
of these outward signs of inner processes; but a little observation will convince one
that the posture assumed by the body—the poise of the head and the position of the
hands—as well as the many alternations of color and of general nutrition, are just as
striking evidences of the course of thought. The subject thus developed by the author
becomes quite extensive, and is exceedingly interesting. The work is fully up
to the standard maintained in ‘The International Scientific Series.’”—<i>Science.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“Among those, besides physicians, dentists, and oculists, to whom Dr. Warner’s
book will be of benefit are actors and artists. The art of gesticulation and of postures
is dealt with clearly from the scientific student’s point of view. In the chapters concerning
expression in the head, expression in the face, expression in the eyes, and in
that on art criticism, the reader may find many new suggestions.”—<i>Philadelphia
Press.</i></p>

<p class='c021'><b>COMMON SENSE OF THE EXACT SCIENCES.</b> By the
late <span class='sc'>William Kingdon Clifford</span>. With 100 Figures. 12mo.
Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is one of the volumes of ‘The International Scientific Series,’ and was originally
planned by Mr. Clifford; but upon his death in 1879 the revision and completion
of the work were intrusted to Mr. C. R. Rowe. He also died before accomplishing his
purpose, and the book had to be finished by a third person. It is divided into five
chapters, treating number, space, quantity, position, and motion, respectively. Each
of these chapters is subdivided into sections, explaining in detail the principles underlying
each. The whole volume is written in a masterful, scholarly manner, and the
theories are illustrated by one hundred carefully prepared figures. To teachers especially
is this volume valuable; and it is worthy of the most careful study.”—<i>New York
School Journal.</i></p>

<p class='c021'><b>JELLY-FISH, STAR-FISH, AND SEA-URCHINS.</b> Being
a Research on Primitive Nervous Systems. By <span class='sc'>G. J. Romanes</span>,
F. R. S., author of “Mental Evolution in Animals,” etc. 12mo.
Cloth, $1.75.</p>

<p class='c008'>“A profound research into the laws of primitive nervous systems conducted by one
of the ablest English investigators. Mr. Romanes set up a tent on the beach and examined
his beautiful pets for six summers in succession. Such patient and loving
work has borne its fruits in a monograph which leaves nothing to be said about jelly-fish,
star-fish, and sea-urchins. Every one who has studied the lowest forms of life on
the sea-shore admires these objects. But few have any idea of the exquisite delicacy
of their structure and their nice adaptation to their place in nature. Mr. Romanes
brings out the subtile beauties of the rudimentary organisms, and shows the resemblances
they bear to the higher types of creation. His explanations are made more
clear by a large number of illustrations. While the book is well adapted for popular
reading, it is of special value to working physiologists.”—<i>New York Journal of
Commerce.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>“A most admirable treatise on primitive nervous systems. The subject-matter is
full of original investigations and experiments upon the animals mentioned as types
of the lowest nervous developments.”—<i>Boston Commercial Bulletin.</i></p>
